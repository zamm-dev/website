Have you ever driven somewhere to visit family? Have you ever done that with your wife and kids in the car? The kids start complaining about wanting something to munch on, so you pull into the nearest convenience store. You wait in the car as your wife and kids leave to pick out their favorite snacks; all you want from there is a bottle of iced coffee, and you'd rather not bother with unbuckling your seatbelt if they're going to fetch it for you anyway. You drum your fingers on the steering wheel, thinking about all the errands you still have to get to later this week, thinking about your boss getting on your case about that one project at work, thinking about what a long night it will be with relatives, thinking about --

The entire convenience store explodes. You'd been living the dream life with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids, but it felt so quotidian to you, you didn't even realize what you had until it completely vanished in an instant right in front of your eyes. Gone, just... everyone's just...

Gone.

They're *gone*.

[Someone out there](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/27/woman-and-children-killed-sisaket-thailand-cambodia-border-dispute) experienced some version of this in real life. I can't even imagine how that feels; I can only try to imagine the car trips that I myself have been a part of, except that they somehow ended as nightmarishly as this one did. I mean, what the *fuck*, man? How do you even find the will to live after that? I hope I never have to be even half as strong as this man is.

Towards the end of last month, [a little conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Cambodia%E2%80%93Thailand_border_conflict) sparked up between Cambodia and Thailand. I say "little" because it's small relative to all the other conflicts that have existed and are existing, but even a "small" conflict will still easily be the biggest thing that's happened to a lot of people's lives. This is [apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonCredibleDefense/comments/yitr33/comment/iuky50x/?context=1) the very idea behind the title of the book [*All Quiet on the Western Front*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front): the main character is killed on a day of the war that is so utterly unremarkable, the full report from the front lines back up the chain of command was "All quiet on the Western Front." Even trivial military conflicts result in untold grief and human suffering.

### Air strikes

On the 24th, I was hanging out at a friend's home and heard what sounded like very loud thunder. Lightning and thunder strikes are common enough during rainy season here in Cambodia, so I didn't give it much mind until someone asked whether it was thunder. We went outside onto the balcony and heard what sounded like military planes flying around. I must say, there is a certain primal dread in hearing the awe-inspiring deep rumble of potentially hostile aircraft without being able to see them in the sky at all. You're painfully aware that extreme danger is lurking nearby, but you have no idea when or where it might strike, and there's simply no hiding from modern weaponry when all you have around you is flimsy civilian construction.

We all calmed down as soon as we verified on the weather app that there were also definitely a lot of lightning strikes happening in the distance, some of which we could even see with our naked eye. Siem Reap is quite far from the front lines, so it couldn't have been the bombings we read about on the news. Besides, we saw no plumes of smoke rising anywhere, so nothing within our line of sight was hit, and that's saying a lot given how flat Siem Reap is.

At the same time,

1. The sky was sunny and clear of storm clouds all around where we were at
2. The noise of the thunder lasted a good bit longer than what I'm used to
3. The thunder sounded like it was coming from a few hundred meters away, whereas lightning strikes on the horizon are usually silent at that distance
4. The plane noises did not sound at all like what I am used to from commercial airliners
5. We don't really hear commercial airliners flying overhead in Siem Reap anyways
6. Cambodia has [no air force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Cambodian_Air_Force) to speak of except for some old MiGs that don't even appear to be operational anymore, so it's quite unlikely to have been friendlies

A Russian friend of mine who was in Siem Reap at the same time recounted how he was in a sauna that day with some Khmer guys. When the thundering booms rolled in, the Khmer guys all started shouting, neither in panic nor celebration but simply as a great accompanying outburst of energy. So it was definitely a widely perceived phenomenon that day.

Both that Russian friend and another Ukrainian friend mentioned how the "thunder" sounded just like the noise from when Russia blew up the ammo dumps near Kharkiv a few years ago. They claimed that such large explosions can be heard from 100km away, which I found a bit hard to believe, so I tried doing some research into that claim.

I found [one source](https://www.denix.osd.mil/dodnoise/denix-files/sites/99/2024/01/blast_noise.pdf) stating that artillery and tank fire can travel "often ten miles or more," but that's only 16 km or more. Later on, that source also states that an explosion of 5 lbs of C4 can be as loud as 120 dB just 2 km away from the blast, and if the attenuation of 1 dB per kilometer at the 30 Hz frequency described there is constant, that does work out to the sound attenuating over 100 km to being just as barely audible [as a whisper is](https://www.iacacoustics.com/article/comparative-examples-of-noise-levels). At the same time, it's very common for conventional bombs such as the [Mark 82](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_82_bomb), described as "one of the smallest bombs in current service," to contain hundreds of pounds of explosives, and if an ammo dump is hit, perhaps the resultant explosions are a great deal louder than 5 lbs of C4.

I found [another source](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023GL104031) that detected infrasound from an explosion 127 km away, although infrasound travels way better than humanly audible noise.

As for the plane noises... the [F-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon) is supersonic and has a service ceiling of 50,000ft. It seems the [sonic boom path](https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104540/sonic-boom/) extends an extra mile away for every 1,000 ft in altitude, and 50 miles works out to only about 80 km.

Meanwhile, the distance to the temple from my friend's home in Siem Reap is around 125 km:

It's unclear to me where exactly Cambodian military positions were relative to the temple, so it's possible the actual explosions were closer than the 125 km distance to the temple itself. That being said, I just don't see a simple way to make the physics work. (My undergraduate degree in physics has long rotted away from disuse, leaving me with a complete state of ignorance around the proper modeling of acoustics in such a situation.)

Perhaps a different approach would be more fruitful. Checking my timestamps, I had sent a text to my friend at 4:25 PM saying that I was coming up his stairs. Then I found [this article](https://world.thaipbs.or.th/detail/thai-f16s-launch-second-strike-on-cambodian-military-targets/58319), published on the 24th:

> At about 5pm today, the Royal Thai Airforce launched a second round of strikes on Cambodian military targets, south of the Ta Muen Thom ancient temple in Phanom Dongrak district of Surin province.

The timestamps match up. We had heard the "thunder" after hanging out for a short while.

A couple days later, I talked to another friend who said she heard a "hoo-hoo" sound the night before. When I asked her for more details, she confirmed that it was low-pitched and sounded like wind, but also not quite like wind. The description matches the plane noises I'd heard on the day of the first bombings. We'd never heard such sounds before in Siem Reap, and now multiple of us started hearing them right after the start of the conflict.

All I have is circumstantial evidence. The physics doesn't *quite* seem to add up, at least not with the information that I'm given. But with the circumstantial evidence that exists... I'm personally inclined to think that maybe, just maybe, the highly unusual sounds we heard that day were in fact jets and bombs. Perhaps our collective relief at discovering lightning strikes so distant that we had to look them up on the weather app was just us grasping at straws to deny the reality that we were actually witnessing in real life the terrifying sounds of modern warfare.

### Fighting over the family estate

Living in Cambodia, it is completely obvious that it was the Thais who started the whole thing. Anyone capable of reading the local Khmer news can tell beyond a shred of doubt that the Thais are the undisputed aggressor here. You know it, your neighbor knows it, the person at the local bar knows it. There is a shared sense of justified indignation at having suffered such unprovoked attacks, and a shared fear over what it might mean for the local economy.

I am sure that for those living in Thailand who are capable of reading the local Thai news, the opposite is just as obviously true. One can hardly fault fans for being insufficiently objective when it comes to their home team; when has anyone ever booed a referee for ruling unfairly in their team's favor? I don't mean to both-sides this conflict; I think most everyone in both nations will agree that there is in fact a right side and a wrong side to this conflict, even if they vehemently disagree on which side is which, just as China and Taiwan do for [their own conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Consensus). But I can appreciate now why there is so much [anti-war media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_War_(film)) that centers on the raw experience of war itself rather than the political impetuses behind war. Wherever our origins may have been, once the bombs start exploding, we find that we have ventured into a truly regrettable dimension of human existence.

The conflict -- at least the public parts of it, for who knows what private spats the key decision-makers on each side may have between themselves -- revolves around the historical temples on the Thai-Cambodian border. Now, I am well aware that there are many who would [gladly sacrifice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulce_et_decorum_est_pro_patria_mori) their lives to preserve the sacred symbols of national heritage and cultural pride. But is this what the ancestors would have wanted? This is where I am going to demonstrate the incredible thickheadedness of an American who lacks even the smallest shred of understanding that other cultures have values vastly different from mine -- but bear with me if you will for just a moment, and consider that those who built [Ta Muen Thom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prasat_Ta_Muen_Thom) about [a thousand years ago](https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/all-europeans-are-related-if-you-go-back-just-1-6c9826523) are [mathematically likely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_ancestors_point) to be the ancestors of every single person in the region today (expats excepted).

Imagine that you die happy after a long and satisfying life where you got to see all your kids grow up healthy and strong. Then you hang around for a little while longer and watch in horror as your children begin murdering one another over your legacy. If you could speak to them, what is it that you would want to say to them? Wouldn't you tell your kids to forget all the accomplishments you've ever achieved in life? Wouldn't you rather they razed everything you ever did to the ground than to keep on stabbing each other in a never-ending cycle of violence? Wouldn't you plead, "Just please stop killing each other over the inheritance. *Please*. I'm damn proud of what I accomplished during my lifetime, but now it's your turn to live yours, and... look, none of what I did in the past matters anymore. Just, please just go and live a good life and forget about me, okay? You, *all of you*, are my beautiful legacy more than anything else in this world, and it deeply hurts to see you care more about the physical remnants of my handiwork than each other."

Perhaps I'm projecting my own modern sensibilities onto ancient cultures. Perhaps that's not what the ancestors would say after all.

Or perhaps, in spite of all the rhetoric around history... perhaps this is not truly about the ancestors and how great they were, but instead about each respective population's *present* sense of identity and how much that present identity rests on perceived ancestral greatness. Perhaps even if the ancestors were to beg, their begging would fall on deaf ears, because it's not about them, it's about us and our present identitarian needs.
