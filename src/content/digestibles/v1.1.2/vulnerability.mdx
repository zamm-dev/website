A little while back, a friend of mine expressed wonder at how I'm able to be so vulnerable online. I didn't really think of myself as being particularly vulnerable at the time; am I really saying much of anything that can and will be used against me? There are of course some who are [completely open](https://sive.rs/ws) about who they are, to the point of even letting others read their "super-super private" diary. I have a *much* stronger sense of privacy than that. How many of the events in my private day-to-day life can you actually reconstruct from these public entries?

And yet when I look back on recent blog posts from this year, I find that a strong sense of cringe prevents me from rereading them until more time has passed. Look at me, discovering super basic life lessons that I should have grasped long ago, heralding them with all the excited naïveté of an innocent child, as if they were the deepest revelations to mankind since sliced bread.

But why shouldn't I approach life with the child-like wonder of one of today's [lucky 10,000](https://xkcd.com/1053/)? I am after all still a very young Adult -- not "adult" in the legal sense of being at least 18 years old, which was a meaningless milestone I have long since surpassed, but "Adult" in the psychological sense of finally [taking responsibility](/blog/v1.0.0/#the-first-night) for the outcomes of my own life. For example, my past attitude towards [my struggles with motivation and productivity](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.1/my-personal-struggles-with-ed/) had been to go to a therapist and [have them fix it for me](/blog/digestibles/v0.1.4/therapeutic-approaches-to-procrastination/): "I got mental issues, and you're the person who's supposed to fix my mental issues, so just tell me exactly what it is I need to do and I'll do just that. Ideally, you give me some pills to pop, I pop them, and that's that." And when even the experts responsible for fixing my issues for me failed at their task, what more could I do? I languished on in learned helplessness until circumstance led me out to a place where I can finally recognize the futility of outsourcing all care for my health to healthcare professionals. No, healthcare professionals are at best trustworthy advisors. It is my responsibility to actually care about my own health, my responsibility to obtain satisfactory healthcare outcomes for myself, whether they be mental or physical. [The buck stops here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_passing#%22The_buck_stops_here%22), not with my [faulty advisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Tsar,_bad_Boyars).

You don't know what age you'll be once you finally wake up from being a [Puer Aeternus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0ec2-E5Xq8). Some find themselves waking up at far too young an age, having had adult responsibilities traumatically forced upon them by their lot in life. I found myself to be a 29-year-old infant Adult, and I've been continuing to grow since then under an infantile sense of wonder befitting an infantile Adult.

A friend once pointed out to me how the [cringiest things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRBsaJPkt2Q) are often the very things that we just grew out of, as if we cringe in order to distance ourselves from our most recent selves that we're so clearly *not* anymore. That seems to describe my cringe pretty well. Pick just about any paragraph I wrote from a few months ago, and my attitude towards it will likely be somewhere along the lines of *Pah, that was so very few-months-ago me*. I don't stand by it anymore, at least not in the same exact way. If I were to talk about that topic now, I would definitely frame things differently. Even if the facts should still happen to be identical, the feelings have diverged, and it is cringe for me to be reminded of the extent to which I had unironically inhabited certain perspectives.

Yet I suspect that it's impossible to drill down so deeply into the present without hitting such time-dependent truths. The exercise of great care in the selection of long-lived intellectual positions requires a certain level of detachment from the passion of the present moment. If each blog post is a faithful high-fidelity snapshot of me in a given month, then it's to be expected that with the passage of time, these blog posts of old will come to speak for me as little as photos of old do.

Even knowing this, I find myself compelled to write as truly as I possibly can. If I cannot speak for my future self, then neither can my future self speak for me. Someone has to stand up and represent me as I am now, to make it absolutely clear that there does indeed exist a person who unironically believes such things as I do, who therefore acts as I do and feels as I do. I exist, and my existence is to be contended with, not merely brushed aside as a trifling inconvenience for some future me looking to streamline the contours of his personal narrative. This is the trail I find myself on for this messy trek through life, and *this* is the footprint I wish to leave behind this month, as cringe as it may come to look once the mud dries.

But if a record of personal history is the motive, why not keep such essays private instead? After all, I don't get that same sense of cringe coming across my private notes from the past, outdated though they may be. It's as if the cringe is only there as a repudiation of a public proclamation; if there is no public proclamation, there is no need for an act of public distancing either. Still I write and still I publish, because nothing else serves as a sufficiently strong catalyst for me to really think through and crystallize an idea in a concise, concrete manner as much as writing for a potentially public audience does. Even if the audience is likely to be empty, the mere fact that a random passerby could randomly stumble in and observe my performance means that I am unwilling to put my name on anything of insufficient Quality -- and the fact that these serve as a compact repository of sufficiently high-Quality information means they're all the more useful to myself than the random slop I let myself get away with in my private scribbles. I understand now that I am a person who benefits greatly from having external structure in his life, and these public-facing monthly blog posts are at this point in time important load-bearing pillars of self-reflection and affirmation.

### The Meta

And here I go again, endlessly questioning and then justifying my own behavior to myself. I started with a feeling of cringe, and I ended with a consoling explanation to myself of why the cringe is actually not so cringe. But why such skittishness around whether I'm doing the right thing or being a cringey fool? Why not have some self-respect and simply unironically own it? Why not just do things for no reason, just 'cause, instead of [overthinking it](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.1/mental-off-switches/) and searching for some solid theoretical basis to ground my actions in?

One obvious reason would be that I greatly enjoy furthering my understanding of myself and my own psychology. Why is it that I do some things and not other things? Fleshing out the first-order reasons as I've done in the first part of this essay is really quite fun, and fleshing out the reasons for the reasons as I'm doing now is exactly the sort of [meta-level thinking](https://xkcd.com/917/) that I deeply dig. One of my favorite cybernetic diagrams is [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-order_cybernetics#Relationship_to_first-order_cybernetics) from Wikipedia:

<img src="/posts/v1.1.2/second-order-cybernetics.png" alt="Second-order cybernetics diagram" />

which comes with the corresponding explanation:

> Most specifically, and especially where phrased as the cybernetics of cybernetics, second-order cybernetics is the recursive application of cybernetics to itself... A key concept in second-order cybernetics is that observers (and other actors, such as designers, modellers, users...) are to be understood as participants within the systems with which they are engaged, in contrast to the detachment implied in objectivity and conventional scientific practice. This includes cyberneticians inclusion of themselves in the practice of cybernetics, as well as the inclusion of participants within the consideration and design of systems more generally. 

In other words, the top part of the diagram is the usual understanding of cybernetics: you're engineering a system and modeling it as a set of inputs and outputs, with feedback loops connecting the output as yet another input into the system. The classic example is that of a [governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor) on a steam engine: if the governor detects that the steam engine is going too fast, it restricts the valve, and vice versa, causing the steam engine system as a whole to dynamically adapt to conditions in order to maintain an approximately constant engine speed. The cybernetic engineer is completely separate from the system; they act upon the system from without, as if they were a god.

The bottom part of the diagram is a meta-understanding of cybernetics: the cyberneticians Wiener, Bateson, and Mead (the ones who [drew that diagram](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003578123-51/god-sake-margaret-conversation-gregory-bateson-margaret-mead-gregory-bateson-margaret-mead)) are themselves part of the feedback loop of the entire system of "cybernetician plus the base system the cybernetician is working on." The cybernetician takes the observed output of the base cybernetic system and loops it back into the input data from which they engineer the base system, causing the cybernetician-and-base-system system as a whole to dynamically adapt to conditions in order to maintain approximately working functionality. The cybernetic engineer is a fundamental part of the overall system acting on itself from within. The entire field of cybernetics could itself be modeled in this way: cyberneticians have a theory for how cybernetics works, but then they observe the results of applying theory to practice, and in doing so update their working understanding of how cybernetics works.

Along these lines, I fancy myself a model train builder who's building a miniaturized model railway system of the entire universe inside my own head. It's very incomplete, and it has a number of erroneous details that I am currently unaware of because many of the reference materials I've consulted have themselves been inaccurate in subtle ways, not to mention all the errors I've made myself in interpreting those reference materials. Inside that miniaturized model railway system is a tiny little miniaturized model of me, sitting in a miniaturized train car. There's only so much detail that my shaky metaphorical hands are capable of sculpting via the scapel of intrapersonal Socratic dialogue, but one of the details I *am* capable of adding is that of a recursive version of miniaturized me [sculpting myself](https://xkcd.com/878/) inside of an even smaller miniature world. It is perhaps questionable how much practical benefit I stand to gain from attempting to sculpt myself with such accuracy, but like most hobbyists, I engage in this hobby simply because it's inherently enjoyable to do so.

### The Meta-meta

And would you look at that: me questioning and then justifying my own overthinking to myself. Why must I justify my own overthinking? Why not simply overthink and own *that*? But overthinking without overthinking my overthinking is exactly what led me here in the first place! Oh, the delightfully ironic recursiveness of it all. Yes please, more dopamine hits from overthinking! Trigger that reward circuitry!

### The Meta-meta-meta

But really, there is a continual pattern of "Why am I acting this way?" as if I am secretly worried that I might be doing something stupid or wrong, followed by a rationalization for why it may actually be reasonable for me to act this way. It is not the act of introspection that is a problem, it is the underlying sense of implied anxiety behind the introspection that gives off an air of defensiveness around the whole thing, as if I am constructing ramparts of impenetrable logic to defend myself from hypothetical assaults on my self-expression. Perhaps I am finally self-conscious that I am being vulnerable online after all, or else there would be no need for such psychological defenses.

Perhaps this is an expression of the anxiety of finding myself [all alone](/blog/v1.1.1/) for the first time in my life, an anxiety borne not out of loneliness but out of making life choices on the daily without anyone around me to reassuringly validate that I am not majorly fucking up my life. I can now drink myself to oblivion and pass out on the streets overnight without anyone knowing or caring. What am I *doing* still staying out here all by myself? I can stagnate in life without anyone knowing or caring. That is truly terrifying.

I've not come face-to-face with such intense anxiety in a long time. But I have much better tools than ever to say hello to Anxiety, my old friend, how have you been? Welcome back, buddy. You can stay as long as you'd like; mind you, I don't have a big space here, but we'll find a way to settle in together and make ourselves all cozy and comfy.

Is Anxiety the best roommate I've ever had? No, I wouldn't say so, not by a long shot. But a friend in need is a friend indeed, and so long as I got a home, Anxiety's got a home.

### The Meta-meta-meta-meta

Now if I take yet another step back, I find that this is a great example of the way in which my mind wanders during meditation. I enter meditation in some way with some initial intention, perhaps the intention of allowing myself to feel and observe my own feelings, to be vulnerable and connect with myself. Ah, vulnerability... now all sorts of thoughts start bubbling up that are related to the philosophical concept of vulnerability. Before I even know it, I've embarked on a mental escapade that I eventually drop back out of an unknown amount of time later and...

Right. Meditation. How did I get so distracted? Ah, it was *that* thought pattern that keeps cropping up in these ways. What an interesting one that is... and before I even know it, I've embarked on yet another mental escapade.

Sometimes the thought loops lead me full circle back to meditation -- *Oh, right, that's the reason why we're meditating right now*. And since this is where I now find myself, [this is where I'll start](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/815715.Start_Where_You_Are) meditating once again.
