A female friend once told me me how all the left-wing feminist critiques of men were good valid knowledge to have, but she wished it were put in context so that she had more of a perspective than "Ugh, men." I feel that way about left-wing critiques of capitalism. After finishing high school under the sole influence of Christian textbooks extolling the pure benefits of laissez-faire capitalism, it was a very good thing that I then went to college to learn about market externalities and all the ways in which a reliance on the profit motive alone is insufficient for tackling a [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem) of [issues](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). My disillusionment with [Young Earth creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism) at the time fueled a great teenage rebellion against all other established orthodoxies I had been taught, and the Internet was of course ready to step in for a hard swing in the opposite direction. But as useful as it was to learn about the myriad systemic issues plaguing globalized society in general and the manifestations of that in the US in particular, I wish that knowledge were better contextualized so that it didn't end up dampening my own internal locus of control.

It may be true that mass collective action is the only way to force a correction on systemic issues within a democracy. Even the POTUS has historically been constrained in his powers, and a POTUS that is to make sweeping changes to the existing order can currently only do so with the support and consent of a great many. But such grand upwellings of national fervor for change are essentially background phenomena beyond your control. You can absolutely be an active part of it, but no matter which way you swing or how you change your mind over time, you'll only ever be another statistic in how exactly these overlapping memetic waves criss-crossed America and bounced around reflecting and refracting across different demographic boundaries over time.

Large societal forces far beyond your personal control set the bounds on your future chances for a good life, and no amount of fiddling with your own systemic output is going to noticeably budge those large societal forces. You work hard for your entire adulthood and find yourself finally ready to enjoy your well-deserved retirement, just for your country to [give up existing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union) altogether, and the new leaders in charge most certainly don't have the money to fund your retirement the way it was promised to you in your youth. You spend decades patiently crafting a cozy life for your family, but then [war comes knocking](/blog/v1.1.2/) and all of you are immediately wiped out by [one side](https://www.jewishgen.org/blog/?p=family-trees-of-the-october-7-attack) or [the other](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2024/10/8/know-their-names-palestinian-families-killed-in-israeli-attacks-on-gaza). What an utter absurdity it is for feast or famine to be determined on the sole basis of a collective coin flip.

But this view on the grand narrative of history is not the only view to be had. I can look at the bigger picture and give up doing anything because anything I do can be trivially swept away by war and calamity stemming from unresolved systemic issues, or I can acknowledge and take back the agency that I *do* possess by beginning to calibrate my own decision-making at the level that I exist at. Am I too small to control the larger situation around me? Then I can become normal-sized again by zooming into the part of reality where I am once again big enough to effect change that matters to me. (Zoom in even further, and my personal actions become the overwhelming forces of nature that little critters and microscopic organisms simply have to deal with as they live their lives.) It's in one sense letting go of my smallness, and in another sense accepting my smallness -- truly accepting that I'm too small for the scale I want to live life at, and instead living life at the me-sized scale I actually belong in. There's always something I can decide for myself that will make a difference, even if it's only an internal mental difference in how I decide to relate to the uncontrollable stimuli in front of me. Giving up on the process of calibration altogether feels to me now like passing on valuable opportunities to hone my decision-making life skills.

Is the state of the job market outside of my control? Do interviewers (myself included) do a shit job at actually discerning talent? Yes and yes, but I reclaim my own sovereignty by taking responsibility for my own life. Has my past led me to be easily triggered by certain actions from certain people? Yes, but I reclaim my own power by taking responsibility for my own triggers. I can understand the effects that society and others have had on me without needing to blame anyone for the way I still am. I can be legitimately hurt, and need to legitimately heal, without having to take myself or anyone else to task for the hurt that sometimes just happens from living with other living beings in this world.

I like the distinction of organizations as ["live" versus "dead" players](https://samoburja.com/live-versus-dead-players/), which I take to mean organizations that still have true agency versus organizations that have ossified into functioning as automatons. A sclerotic "dead" organization can only pick from a pre-ordained set of bureaucratic responses to an event. A live one will reshape its internal processes *as needed* in order to most effectively respond to a changing environment. A "dead" person shambles along according to internal drives and external stimuli that dictate their actions and reactions at any given moment, without so much as a shred of responsibility to be found for their own behavior. A live person will look for a way to reshape their behavior given all of the internal drives and external stimuli that they must work with.

To take an analogy from [heat conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity_and_resistivity) and the ["emotional contagion" experiment](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1320040111) on Facebook, "dead" people are good conductors of vibes, whether good or bad. If they're having a great day, they'll be passing on the good vibes straight to random strangers. If they're having a shit day, they'll be passing on the bad vibes straight to random strangers as well. They're not true living agents that serve as [windbreaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains_Shelterbelt) from the karmic Dust Bowls of the world; they're instead bits of inert matter forever pushed this way and that by forces beyond their control, never responsible for their own behaviors because it's always this thing or that person that's caused them to do what they did in the way that they did it. The refusal to take responsibility is the refusal to update the weights of your own neural network based on the [observable loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_function), the refusal to integrate [corrective action](https://www.praxisframework.org/en/library/cybernetic-control) based on environmental feedback, and therefore the inability to respond any more effectively than you already are. (Like Samo says in his original definition, these are not fixed categories. I have been both kinds of people, perhaps even on the same day.)

As Dr. K said in [his Puer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGFqdVqDhqo), transcending Puer (which I interpret as being "live") is not about doing a specific thing. "Just give up because it's impossible" can be Puer, especially if the "it's impossible" point is reached after just one or two tries and there's no other backup plan to go for afterwards. But the opposite cultural message of "You just have to keep trying and you'll get there" can also be Puer -- simply mashing the ["Try Harder" button](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-6-stop-pressing-the-try-harder-button) again and again even though you keep failing, instead of truly taking the time to understand and experiment with your repeated failures, is also being a dead player. Being dead or alive isn't about executing the right moves, it's about having the dynamism with which you generate the right moves to execute.

I recognize in my past self the [Desire to Pass Tests](https://www.conradbastable.com/essays/escalation-theory-compliance-violence-and-overachievement-in-society) of life via the bureaucratic execution of procedures in the booklet of decentralized cultural wisdom. I would take the next bureaucratic booklet handed to me, execute the instructions therein, and discard the instruction manual once it showed itself to clearly not work. If something was handed to me that didn't look like a bureaucratic booklet, I would try to make it into one. "Okay, so what exactly are you telling me is the thing I need to do? Look, just tell me what to do and I'll do it." I looked for a clear-cut answer like a bureaucrat who cannot be fired so long as they follow the rules precisely and exactly. I judged myself by the [system of accountability](https://www.niskanencenter.org/culture-eats-policy/) where I am responsible for having done things according to the book of "Things That Any Reasonable Person Would Do," and so long as [I did everything right](youtube.com/shorts/y5GDAR6xTnw), I cannot be held to blame for the outcomes of my actions. But reclaiming personal sovereignty requires accepting personal responsibility, and that involves being able to admit to myself that I've messed up somehow, even if I don't know how, and even if I followed every step correctly.

I now see why I made the [FML](/blog/digestibles/v1.0.3/fml/) for myself as an emotional support manual: It is an attempt to create exactly what I have been looking for all this time, despite realizing that it is [entirely useless as a crutch](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.1/incidental-output/) because the magic is not actually in the manual. The magic is not anywhere to be found except within me. (Or as the saying goes, "Change must come from within." God, these cheesy quotes plastered onto tacky motivational posters only reveal their true elegance after they're no longer needed.) I have to remind myself of this every time I see a new clickbaity YouTube video titled "This is Why You're Stuck at This Specific Point in Your Life." Ah yes, here is [The Answer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zero_Theorem) I've been waiting for that will finally save me from figuring things out for myself! But no, no matter how useful the YouTube algorithm may be, I am always going to have to be the one who does the hard work of [integrating](https://uncertainupdates.substack.com/p/drugs-and-awakening) any gleaned knowledge into my own life.

This is not to say that I find the FML to be completely useless for myself. There's a tradeoff to be found between standardization and efficiency (offloading the mental load of decision-making onto pattern-matchable solutions) versus adaptability and agility (decision-making when dealing with in-the-moment on-the-ground reality that differs drastically from what Centralized Planner-me had cooked up from [incomplete information passed into flawed models](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/)), and the things I put into the FML tend to be the things I internalize best, although it's possible the causation runs the other way.

Nor is it to say that accepting personal responsibility for my mess-ups means being harsh on myself. I don't find self-blame useful. The Algorithm of Me is already learning at the optimum rate it possibly can. Perhaps other biological neural nets in the world were randomly initialized with better weights and better hyperparameters, but this is peak gradient descent on the weights and hyperparameters I got initialized with. Mistakes that involve choosing [the "wrong" bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit) still result in information gain that increases my expected future payout. These sorts of mess-ups are exactly what I would expect to see if I were on the right path. Accepting personal responsibility doesn't mean beating myself up over my mistakes. It just means accepting that mistakes were made in the first place. I can't learn from my mistakes if my ego is blocking me from recognizing them as negative training data.
