In some ways, I love my mind like I love my mom. I have a beautiful mind. I really love my mind. I'm blessed to have such a mind. But sometimes, I seriously need my mind to just *shut the fuck up*.

To that end, my mind has gone off and discovered a couple off-switches for itself, tools in the toolbox for me to tamp down my overthinking as needed.

### I'm dumb now

As part of the treatment for the aforementioned ear infection, I took metronidazole for ten days. Fuck, that was the roughest medicine I've had in a while. Dizziness and confusion came on pretty quickly, followed by pain around my heart area. Is this normal? As usual, the internet was here to reassure me about [side effects](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/metronidazole-oral-route/description/drg-20064745) and their potential meanings:

> Check with your doctor right away if you have dizziness, ... These may be symptoms of a serious brain condition called encephalopathy.
>
> Call your doctor right away if you have confusion, ..., a headache, ... These could be symptoms of a serious condition called aseptic meningitis.

Encephalopathy? That sounds serious. [What is it?](https://www.advocatehealth.com/health-services/brain-spine-institute/brain-care-center/conditions-treatments/encephalopathy)

> The condition may result in either temporary or permanent brain damage, and it can also lead to long-term and life-altering complications including a coma.

Oh fuck! I dutifully went back to the doctor. Normal vitals all around. They told me to finish the course of medicine.

The confusion got very noticeable:

- I referred to my neighbor as my "roommate" -- although in retrospect, I think this is because he's the first neighbor I've had whom I've become as close to as a roommate.
- When discussing the weather, I said "the sky in the clouds" instead of "the clouds in the sky."
- I mixed up near-homophones with different spellings, like typing "due" instead of "do."
- I was writing a message on a group chat when I decided I should perhaps send it privately instead. I pressed "Select All" on the phone to prepare for a cut-and-paste, and then proceeded to hit the "Send" button instead of the "Cut" button. Not only did I press the wrong button, I also had no idea I'd pressed the wrong button and was confused as to what had just happened with the UI.

God, I could notice myself getting dumber. How many IQ points was this medication costing me right now? I reflected on how I've never taken an IQ test, never even felt the desire to do so, because it somehow just feels crass, as if the very act of taking an IQ test proves that I need to prove something about myself. But I realized that it was also because I feared the results. It wasn't the low results I feared -- in fact, if I got a result of 70, I'd be gloating about it to everyone I knew. "Bro, did you know that I'm literally fucking retarded? No seriously man, I took an official IQ test and it shows that I'm fucking retarded! Hahahaha dude, can you believe that we're standing together in the same room right now? You've made it to the same point in life as a certified retard!" A super low result would be absolutely hilarious. But a super high result would feel embarrassing, like I ought to be ashamed that I am where I am in life given what I've been given. High intelligence feels like a burden in this way, as if the higher your intelligence, the more of society's problems you're expected to shoulder.

But "smart" and "dumb" are just labels. If I'd prefer finding out that I had a low IQ than a high IQ, why not just apply the label of "dumb" to myself and see how it feels? Here was after all the perfect chance to ease myself into the role. You see, metronidazole had given me permanent brain damage. It killed off the one vital neuron that, through a freak accident, became responsible for 70% of my cognitive skills. I'm a dumbfuck now.

Turns out, there's a certain dignity to living a simple life as a dumb person. Oh, did I just say something stupid? Well I'm dumb man, what did you expect?

I may be dumb, but if you're looking down on me for being dumb, that's 100% on you. I'm just living my life in the dumb way that I live it.

You know a perk of being dumb? I don't got to think about nothing, I just do what I'm told. I wake up every day to some sunrise yoga because that's what the authority figure at that meditation retreat center told me to do. I dunno, take it up with him.

I spend my time doing hobbies of no greater importance because I dunno, they're fun and I'm too dumb to figure out how to contribute to humanity. I mean look, if Humanity tells me, "Hey we need you to pick up a shovel and dig this hole right here," then all right, I guess that's what I gotta do. But right now Humanity says, "It's not our responsibility to find a job for you, aight? Go figure it out yourself." Well, shit man, I'm too dumb to figure it out myself, so I guess I'm just gonna work on my hobbies until such time as someone tells me different.

Should I prioritize cooking food now before I get hungry, or should I prioritize taking a break now while I need one? Well I'm dumb, so whatever option I choose will probably be the wrong one -- even if I do that smart thing of picking the opposite of whatever I originally picked. So, I dunno, I'm just gonna go with one of the options and see what happens.

### I've figured it all out

I remember this one time I encountered an epiphany while drunk, as happens so often when one is drunk. Then I encountered an even bigger epiphany right afterwards, one so big that I immediately dropped the first one and forgot about it: I'll never figure it all out. I'll never figure out every last thing there is to figure out about life. Like an infant dying shortly after figuring out how to take their first few breaths of air, I will have lived a whole life on Earth and left without ever fully understanding what it all meant. I might as well get on with living my life in a state of profound unenlightenment, because this is just how it's going to be for the rest of my life.

But then I thought... this is just a label. What if I took [the dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(optimization)) of that label? Life should play out *exactly* the same. Let's see.

The "I'll never understand everything in life" perspective I had before was the realization that no matter how hard I tried, I could only ever asymptotically approach the limit of having understood everything, everywhere, all at once. Every little epiphany I have about life, whether my own life or life in general, helps me navigate this world that much better, but no amount of finite addition is ever going to get me to the Asymptote of Ultimate Enlightenment itself, which legends say graces you with the full wisdom necessary to live out a perfectly optimal life. Ah, if I wanted that forbidden treasure for myself... I was going to have to simply teleport myself onto the Asymptote. As soon as I understood this final epiphany, I was there. I'd done the impossible. I found myself in a celestial palace that no mortal could ever go to. In fact, I didn't even go there myself; I was simply there without having gone there. I had finally figured it all out, and I gleefully affixed to my shirt this "Got It All Figured Out" label I found laying about.

Perhaps you could ask me, "If you think you've figured it all out, then why don't you explain X, huh?" Well, I can't -- and so what if I can't explain the nittiest grittiest details of X? Believe me man, you don't need to understand X to have it all figured out, because *I've* got it all figured out -- look, I even have this "Got It All Figured Out" label I took as a souvenir -- and I certainly didn't need to know that specific factoid to have figured everything out. You see, I've seen enough of the Great Fractal of Everything to understand it all, because to fully understand the tiniest part of a self-similar structure is to fully understand the entire thing. I understand everything now, and understanding everything means understanding that I am relegated to this little corner of the GFE where my mortal mind [lacks understanding](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/534070-i-am-the-wisest-man-alive-for-i-know-one).

Perhaps you could retort with, "The GFE doesn't exist. It's nothing more than an elaborate concoction by high hippies." You are right. Because of the fundamental interconnectedness of all things, the GFE spans all mathematics, all parallel and non-parallel physical and non-physical universes that could have ever existed or even been imagined, everything that ever was as well as nothing that never will be. The GFE is everything, and therefore it is nothing. It spans the yin and yang of existence and non-existence both, so you can apply the labels of "It exists" and "It doesn't exist" equally well. Simply put, if math is real, then the GFE is real, and math is more real than our physical reality. Math existed long "before" time became a well-defined concept with the Big Bang, and it will continue existing long "after" time ceases to be a well-defined concept during the heat death. But everything is an illusion, including our conscious p-zombie selves, and so too is the GFE.

Perhaps you could simply mock, "Look at this guy. Says he's figured it all out, says he understands everything about everything, but if you actually listen to him you realize he's just using a whole bunch of word tricks to cover up the fact that he can't even explain anything about anything. He's fucking insane." Yes, I am induitably insane. It's impossible for the finite human mind to understand absolutely everything about everything without going insane. I was willing to pay the price to comprehend all ultimate truths at once, and so here I am. I understand it all now. I will accept the label of "insane" for so long as I wear the label of "Got It All Figured Out." It comes with the territory.

Well, what do I do now that I possess infinite wisdom and understanding? I just need to be here. Just right here. "Everything" has led to this moment right here, so when you truly figure everything out, you'll also have figured out that right here is right where you need to be. The primal and the dual solutions must match up exactly. You can be wholly unenlightened or wholly enlightened; either way, the way forward for you is identical. Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.

Do I have all the answers to my own life? No, because understanding everything about a binary tree and the algorithm used to construct it means understanding that sometimes you find yourself at a leaf node, and the next step in the algorithm requires you to discover new neighboring leaf nodes from your current state of ignorance. Understanding it all does not mean I am now permanently zoomed-out and above life; understanding it all means I finally understand why it is time for me to return back to the present moment. I teleported myself to infinity and beyond, but when I took one single reciprocal step forward on the [Riemann sphere](https://5010.mathed.usu.edu/Fall2018/LPierson/zeroandinfinity.html), I found myself right back at the origin. The GFE has handed me this specific little corner of the fractal to complete and fill out all the little details of, and I shall oblige. I can appreciate the mystical magical nature of the present moment while simultaneously appreciating that it all adds up and makes complete sense at the deepest level.

I've got it all figured out already, so I am free to stop figuring things out now and just run on my instincts. I guess I've always done that in a way -- it's just that my "thinking" instinct was turned on a lot. Now that thinking instinct has gone and committed suicide in order to transcend into the ultimate afterlife scenario where it's thought for all eternity and finally thought out every thought there was ever to be thought. It was an infinite loop that finally reached the end after infinite execution time, [gave up](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_up_the_ghost) the [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), and went to infinite loop heaven. It wireheaded itself out of existence altogether.

The reasoning I've presented is not meant as an iron-clad proof that "this" is the meaning to life, the universe, and everything. It's merely a party trick, special effects that ease me into the state of mind of having understood it all so that I no longer need to understand at all. A good movie can draw a willing audience in without the use of any special effects, but realistic-looking special effects can go a long way in helping the audience suspend their disbelief prior to fully losing themselves in the story altogether. My reasoning is sufficient for my own private purposes; if it is insufficient for you, then I'm afraid you're going to have to find your own way to teleport yourself onto the Asymptote.
