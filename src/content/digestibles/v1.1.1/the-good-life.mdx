I love myself. I love the person I've become.

I like to believe that this deepens the depth of the love I can give. Just as I once learned to love myself as I loved another, perhaps I can learn to love any other as I love myself.

I like to believe that this deepens the depth of the love I can take. If I am so loved by myself, I can believe it when I am so loved by another.

As the last of my close friends leave Siem Reap, I find myself at the lowest point of my entire adult life, at least on paper. I'm old and dumb, with no girlfriend, no job, no family, and no (close) friends. (Don't worry, remaining folks in Siem Reap -- you're still my friend, but you gotta admit, we ain't *that* close.) But I've never been more capable of living this life. And so, life is good. Life is enough in a way that it hasn't been since childhood.

I'm going to have a good life. I just know it. Old me, distraught with the trauma of losing some [strongly-held core religious beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Earth_creationism), would've asked how I could be so sure that we were going to have a good life.

*You simply believe. Just like you once believed in the mainstream Christian God. Just believe it with all your heart, because it is true.*

Old me would've been paranoid. How could I just believe? We've been wrong with evidence-free beliefs before. We could be wrong with evidence-free beliefs again.

*If we're wrong, then we're wrong, and we'll update our beliefs accordingly. Until then, we believe.*

Old me would've trembled. The question "Are we going to be okay?" is far too important to get wrong.

*On the contrary, [perception is reality](/blog/v0.1.2/). So long as a statement remains unfalsifiable, you are free to choose which axiomatic reality you wish to live in. The question "Are we going to be okay?" produces anxiety when unanswered, so it is far more important to answer it than to get the answer right.*

Old me would've smelled a *reductio ad absurdum*. This is exactly the kind of logic that leads to spending everything now because you'll be okay no matter what anyways.

*We're going to find a way to have a good life even as a homeless person. But is that our preferred flavor of good living? What flavor of good living would we like to taste in this life, the good living on a park bench or the good living under solid shelter?*

I should note that as with all social media, my life comes across in these blog posts as being more full of constant ecstatic joy than it actually is. I think this is important to address because [the highlight reel effect](https://www.ourmental.health/screen-time-sanity/instagrams-highlight-reel-the-mental-health-impact-of-curated-perfection) can cause psychological harm through unfair comparison, not just to random readers of the blog but also especially to my future selves who may one day look back on this period with rose-tinted glasses and wonder how it was that I ever managed to get my shit together in the good old days. First, there is certainly a bias in my writing towards optimism because I only have the energy to write when I'm in a good mood. But an even larger cause is the decoupling of feelings from value judgments. Even if I'm feeling dissatisfied with life, as I very often do, dissatisfaction isn't bad. Dissatisfaction is just dissatisfying. It too is an integral part of a good life.

I'm going to have a good life. So if I want to know what a good life looks like, I just need to look around. After all, living the good life is about recognizing the good life for what it is.
