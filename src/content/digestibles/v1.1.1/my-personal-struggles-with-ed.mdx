Some people have a fundamentally different conception of work than I do. Well, many people have a fundamentally different conception of many things than I do, but work in particular fascinates me, perhaps due to my personal struggles with it.

I told a friend -- let's call him "Andrew" -- that I was retired now. I also told Andrew how I was hacking away at a software project with a business partner, "Brian," to see if it would turn into a viable business. I use the term "business partner" lightly here -- Brian is a true friend and we were trying out a potential business idea, which meant that we had to also contend with the business relationship between us by considering in advance how we would handle the success *or* failure of the business. I have yet another friend "Charles" who worked at a startup founded by a clique of best friends in college. The startup was so successful, it attracted million upon millions of dollars of funding, and for those millions these best friends backstabbed each other until none of them talk to each other anymore. Ooof. Such are the risks of business to friendship.

Andrew retorted that it's one hell of a "retirement" if I'm still working, but completely for free now. Man, Andrew has a way different conception of work and retirement than I do. I mean, come on Andrew, what are you gonna do in your old age, sit and stare at the wall all day? But of course, that is in fact what I do some days. Some days you just want to lay on the couch and not think about anything for hours upon hours. <span class="khmer">លំហែរខួរក្បាល</span>, as they call it in Khmer: "rest your brain." One of the joys of picking up another language is finding new phrases that resonate with you more than your other languages -- somehow "relax your mind" in English or 放松大脑 ("relax your brain") in Chinese doesn't do it for me as much as <span class="khmer">លំហែរខួរក្បាល</span> does. <span class="khmer">លំហែរ</span> (pronounced similar to "lom-high") just *sounds* like you're taking a break with a deep and satisfied sigh.

My friend "David" asked me to go on a trip to Europe this summer. I declined because I felt like resting at home instead. Old people stuff, you know? David asked me incredulously what I'm even resting from if I'm retired. Resting "from"? Man, David sure has a much different conception of work and rest than I do. Who says you need to rest *from* anything? To me, resting in order to do something else is nothing more than a pause in work. The point of *real* rest is to rest. Just like how the point of yoga is the yoga itself, not just to tick off a box on the daily checklist. Just like how the point of life is the life itself, not the accomplishments of the life. Such a viewpoint feels so obvious to me now, I sometimes gaslight myself into wondering how I could've ever thought otherwise at all, before being helpfully reminded that [much of society](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1ll6tfn/meet_william_sidis_a_child_prodigy_who_entered/mzx8lh1/) does in fact judge a stranger's life by their net contributions to society relative to their expected contributions. I didn't get such notions around the [unbearable weight of massive talent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unbearable_Weight_of_Massive_Talent) into my head from out of nowhere.

I met a Cambodian here, "Edward," who's a very hard worker, as many Cambodians are. He's worked since he was a teenager to support himself and his family, and he's working two jobs even now. Edward did not understand why I found the act of remote work itself hard. Not the job being hard -- that he could understand -- but the mere act of sitting down and working being hard. I have a really nice table in my living room; I could sit *there* and work quite comfortably. Yes, I could, except for [executive dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_dysfunction). I couldn't explain that to him in Khmer, and he had never heard of that in English, so I simply told him I was lazy, and then he understood, or at least felt the sensation of understanding.

"Lazy" is perhaps the closest approximation to executive dysfunction that I can think of, and it has also historically been a label I put on myself. But it doesn't really feel like an accurate description to me. "Lazy" implies not doing something because you'd rather not do it. I'm perfectly fine with that. What I struggle with is wanting to do something but not doing it. That's quite different. To me, that sounds way less "lazy" and way more "dysfunctional." It is specifically a dysfunctionality that results in a very low, seemingly close to zero correlation between the actions I intended to execute and the actions I actually executed -- hence, "executive dysfunction" actually being a great name for the phenomenon.

I think it's likely that [people](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BH8BcP7d2sbmzZig8/fighting-akrasia-finding-the-source?commentId=LkHuYgvudQrNDk7Mp) who model this as simply a case of [revealed preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference) have never actually experienced the maddening effects of executive dysfunction extreme enough to cause [severe stress](http://localhost:4321/blog/v0.1.4/) without any noticeable benefits. There was no conscious part of me that *preferred* lying stressed in bed all day to actually doing the remote work; there may have been subconscious parts of me that were trying to be helpful by holding me back from the scary thing that was causing me so much stress, but to say that this is what I've revealed myself to actually "want" to do is a real gaslighting stretch. At the same time, it's entirely fair that someone who has never lived through such a diametrically opposite experience to their own lives would reason about it in completely different ways. It's like feeding a data point way outside of a model's training data and expecting it to come up with something comprehensible and useful.

I once had a coworker "Frank" who was pissed at me for always saying I was going to "try" to do something. "Dude, just fucking *do* it or not," this Yoda-like Frank said. But looking back, I can see how I was optimizing under the constraints of:

1. Wanting to do a favor for Frank because I liked him and didn't want to tell him to fuck off just because I had no formal corporate responsibilities to him. We were close enough that my actual workload was no secret to him.
2. Historical observations that there existed a low amount of correlation between what I intended to do and what I actually did, thus making it feel disingenuous to make a certain promise about an uncertain outcome.

The solution I reached for at the time was to promise full willingness to comply with the request, but to make it clear that the actual execution of the request was out of my hands as far as my conscious language centers were concerned. All of that was supposed to be encapsulated inside the single word "try"; I may have optimized for friendliness and honesty, but I completely neglected clear and effective communication because those skills of mine were much less developed back then.

Executive dysfunction is still something I struggle with, but in recent months the correlation between what I consciously want to be doing and what I am actually doing has strengthened noticeably across multiple timescales. While that strengthening has immeasurably improved my quality of life, I also find myself feeling a severe lack of time. What the hell? I'm retired. I'm not working a full-time job anymore. I am clearly doing something terribly wrong, because I should have all the free time in the world instead of none at all.

But I've found myself in this exact spot before, where an improvement in symptoms led to a new frustration at my inefficient usage of all the time I had in the day, leading me to continually optimize my day away until I burned out and the cycle repeated. I recognize now that running out of time in a day is a *good* sign. It means that I'm finally so capable of doing things that there's more things to do than there is time to do them. I may have [finished my main quest](/blog/v1.1.0/) in life, but there will always be overwhelmingly more side quests to explore than there is time to complete them all. (I use the word "always" in a practical sense -- perhaps I'll be blessed enough to eventually feel like I've truly had enough of life and am ready to leave this world at any time, but it's impractical for me to simply wait until that happens.) Just because the day started out with the full collective potential of all possible timelines but ended with the mundane reality of a single humble path doesn't mean it was any less of a day well-lived or a path well-traveled. As my former boss "Grace" at this one startup would remind us when we developers worried about scaling to more users than we had: It's a problem, but it's a good problem to have.

Which is why it's really funny when I tell Edward that I've been quite busy. "You found a job?" he asked.

Nah. I'm retired, man.

"Oh. I heard you say you were busy."

Yeah. I guess you and I just have really different conceptions of work and life.
