This month, I happened to [add some updates](/posts/v1.1.1/fml-amos-2025-07.pdf) to the [*FML*](/blog/digestibles/v1.0.3/fml/). I realize now it truly is more of an emotional support manual than anything else, because it's the [burrito-monad fallacy](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/) applied to living life. The words in the manual are absolutely useless without all the work I've done to integrate and embody them in the way I live. At best it serves as a reference text to remind me of things that seemed to have worked for me at some point in the past.

I also once again got the bug for ZAMM, and gave implementing it [yet another shot](https://github.com/zamm-dev/zamm-golang-mvp-11/releases/tag/v1.1.1). This is in some sense the furthest I've ever gone in terms of relevant functionality, and in another sense the same as all the other past attempts because it's not practically useful for me yet. However, it does say a lot about [the extent](https://ghuntley.com/six-month-recap/) to which [AI coding](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/the-death-of-the-stubborn-developer-b5e8f78d326b) has improved drastically over the last year, and will almost certainly continue to become even more useful than [it already is](https://www.eric-fritz.com/articles/my-ai-junior-dev-still-needs-an-adult-in-the-room/).
