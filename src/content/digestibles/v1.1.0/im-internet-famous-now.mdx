I got my [first comment ever](https://zamm.dev/blog/v1.0.3/#remark42__comment-8ce100cd-7bb1-49bc-9ad8-4eee7b2ed0d5) from someone I don't recognize, on a line that I hadn't even put in the main blog post. I was so surprised, I confirmed with a friend I had shared the post with that it wasn't them. I don't even know how this Internet stranger found that post because I hadn't publicly advertised it anywhere. I used to submit my posts to Hacker News back when the main focus was still around a software project, even though the interesting parts of the posts weren't software-related. I don't submit my posts anywhere anymore because it feels very me-centric at this point, without even the flimsy excuse of being software-related.

(Another reason I stopped submitting to Hacker News specifically is the fact that my account has been flagged because I was submitting too many of my own posts. Apparently, it's [meant to be](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html) a hub for intellectually interesting articles as opposed to self-promotion. It feels like I was operating on the Internet's default [ask culture](https://jeanhsu.substack.com/p/ask-vs-guess-culture) -- submit whatever you want, and others are free to ignore it -- but HN instead wants more of a guess culture where you shouldn't even ask others to take a look at your own stuff unless it's especially intriguing. Regardless of how self-promotional the forum may appear at times, I respect the moderators' intentions and will now only submit my own work there if I feel that it's sufficiently meaningful.)

I'd been used to getting zero comments and zero upvotes on my posts. I didn't mind at all -- it somehow felt like a slightly bitchy badge of honor that I was still trucking on the way I do even if nobody in the world gave a shit. Not submitting it anywhere on the internet at all wouldn't have worked; I had to find at least a marginally related forum in order to get that sweet satisfaction of "Oh *yeah*, nobody cares!" After HN, I did submit once to [Lemmy](https://programming.dev/post/26900218), where I finally got a handful of upvotes. That was the last time I felt the urge to submit something somewhere.

But this anonymous comment? My god, that's a whole 'nother level of attention. I didn't even ask for it! This is now a parasocial interaction, and that means I'm an Internet celebrity. You may reasonably point out that even getting thousands of comments on TikTok is entirely trivial for internet fame these days, and you'd be completely right. But as far as I'm concerned, that's only a difference in degree, not in kind. What is the exact number of anonymous comments I need to get before I am allowed to feel validated by the public? I say it is at most one.

I was thriving off of complete public indifference to my authenticity, and now I get the option to also thrive off of a wealth of public appreciation for my creative outputs. I get to choose which labels I feel like adorning myself with when I step out the door every day, and it feels good to have an extra option in the wardrobe.

While this sort of glib experimentation with labels and narrative has proven to be very powerful for modulating my internal lived experience, part of me worries that it's almost *too* powerful. It starts to feel like I'm getting close to [wireheading](https://casparoesterheld.com/2016/07/08/wireheading/) myself. I think I'm still safe so long as I keep an eye out for making sure that all my narratives are congruent with objectively observable reality; narrativization to me is the art of searching for a path from observable facts to desired mental states without making the world any more surprising than it already is. (The more accurate your model of reality is, the lower your [cross-entropy loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy#Cross-entropy_loss_function_and_logistic_regression), and if I'm understanding the math correctly, that's equivalent to the sum total [information-theoretic surprise](https://ashwinreddy.github.io/writeups/info-theory.html). So the better you understand the world, the less surprising it will be to you.) I don't actually expect me to be treated any differently as an Internet celebrity; if I did expect that, then I would be quite surprised indeed when I inevitably get treated like a regular anonymous person. I'm simply an Internet celebrity that nobody on the street recognizes -- on days when I feel like being one.
