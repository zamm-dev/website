I've always harbored a deep streak of inner artistry. I may be intellectually inclined towards the exactitude of programming, math, and physics. I may be temperamentally predisposed to objective truth, self-consistency, and pragmatism. I may have a preferred role in society as the Archetypal Builder: Tell me what needs to be done (I'm not the Archetypal Leader/Manager) and how you want it to look (I'm not the Archetypal Designer/Architect), and I'll get it done how I see fit. I may remain a complete and utter amateur at dance, paint, and weaving despite having had lessons in all of those. But I am enamored by the *idea* of those activities. I worship the Quality of craftsmanship that can only come about from the intricate intertwining of practiced skill, natural intuition, and crystallized knowledge, and I greatly wish to forge some artifacts of Quality myself.

To say that "I am an artist" would be implying too much to someone who doesn't know me at all. I am an artist in the philosophical sense, which I would argue is a very legitimate sense of the word, and "artist" is most certainly a label I happily adopt for myself. But as an artist, I had looked to create some magnum opus -- something that could truly quench that deep thirst for artistry within me, if only for a moment -- and in doing so show that I deserved the title I'd lavished upon myself. Alas, even if I were to one day do such a project proper justice, the finish line would be untold months and years away from today.

So it was that one morning, as I danced on the roof next to the glorious Siem Reap sunrise, I realized that my life itself is a far grander masterpiece than any work of art I'll ever produce. Anything I do with my own hands will necessarily pale in comparison to this joint collaboration with Reality. Of course, I don't think my life is special in this regards. It has been an interesting life so far, but certainly not in any world record-setting sort of way. I believe that everyone can make use of this framing if they want to.

But if my life itself is a masterpiece, then it stands to reason that all I have to do to produce good art is to document my own life. I can simply convey that which I find most interesting and beautiful about the sweeping chiaroscuro arcs and ornate baroque flourishes of my own narrative, for enjoyment by an older me who will presumably still have many of the same tastes that I do. For example, last month I'd documented how I [no longer feared](/blog/v1.0.3/#further-difficulties) doing effortful things to improve my life, which was an enormous changed compared to [a year ago](/blog/v0.1.4/). This month, I finally wrangled my finances and budgeting under my near-complete control for the first time in my life, I plan and adhere daily to a schedule that has me waking up at 4:15 AM for yoga and meditation, I regularly complete "random" tasks (like going in for a dental checkup or cleaning my Turkish rug) unprompted instead of leaving them until they're unbearable, I cook, I work on passion projects, and on top of all that I spend more time than ever pursuing the hobbies I enjoy. Ironically, it is in retirement rather than unemployment that I find myself more capable than ever of returning to work. How did this all happen? I mean, I'm now completely unrecognizable to the *me* of a year ago. I wanted to do such interesting themes justice.

Yet as the deadline for this blog post approached, I felt anxious about documenting everything I wanted to document for this month. There was still so much left to write, let alone to edit. But then I realized I'd once again had my priorities flipped. I'm not living in order to write blog posts or create other art. I am writing blog posts and creating other art for -- and as a part of -- my living. The *real* art is the masterpiece itself, the living of my life. Making-of movies are first-class art objects, capable of going on to [earn awards and accolades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_of_Darkness:_A_Filmmaker%27s_Apocalypse) in their own right. It just so happens that the making-of my art is *such* a better story than my art itself, that the resultant art is nothing more than an incidental by-product of the behind-the-scenes artful living of my life.

Am I feeling anxious about making a good life decision? Well, I'm not living in order to make good life decisions. I am making good life decisions for -- and as a part of -- living my life. The decisions are there to help my life, not the other way around. If the decision-making process isn't helping my life, then something about it needs to change, the most likely culprit being my attitude towards it.

Am I feeling anxious about meeting the blog post deadline for this month? Ditto, the deadline serves my life, not the other way around. Am I feeling anxious about meeting the budget for this month? Ditto, the budget serves my life, not the other way around.

This is not to say that my life now is all bliss. Far from it. There are moments when I think, "Ah, when I inevitably look back on this period of my life with rose-tinted glasses in the future, I certainly wouldn't be thinking of 'Ugh' moments like this one right here!" But it truly is all a part of the journey. Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. Everything remains in place, and yet the entire interior experience has turned inside-out. I haven't felt this way since losing my faith in Christianity, when my entire physical and social world remained intact, but I found myself teleported from a reality where the main goal was making sure you got into Heaven at the end of your life to a reality where God never even existed.

There is still a sense of movement and progression in life. But it is a perspective shift akin to riding a train and deciding that you are now in the stationary frame of reference. I'm sitting nice and easy in the present moment as life itself moves about. I'm still jogging, but I'm jogging in place as the forest trees of Angkor Wat decide to brush past me at high speed. There are some locations (aka goals) that would be nice for my life to flow to, but I'm not living in *order* to flow to them, I'm living while keeping an eye out for them as part of my living.

The question naturally arose: If all of this is for my living, then what is it that I am actually living for?

But why must I live *for* anything? Why must I justify my own existence, even to myself? Why shouldn't I simply live?

Old me would've asked, "But what do you mean by 'live'? What are you actually doing when you 'live'? That's pretty tautological, don't you think?" Of course. It's so tautological that the ouroboros collapses in on itself into the infinitesimal present moment. Whatever you're doing right now is living. Observe yourself living, and observe the environment in which you find yourself living. That's living too. Observe yourself living again -- that is, observe yourself observing yourself living -- ad infinitum. I don't know about you, but when I do that, I find myself squarely rooted in the sights, sounds, smells, touch and feel of the here and now. I find that I'm *alive*.
