I fantasized about retirement a lot back when I was working a full-time job. I remember how my boss once saw me checking out Vanguard's retirement planner at work, and asked why I was thinking about retirement when I was still young. The main reason was of course financial: because of the nature of compounding returns, the best time to start planning for your retirement is when you first start working, when any money you put into your retirement fund will have the longest possible time to grow over the decades. But it was also psychological: I didn't enjoy work on a deep level. It was just something I did for money, and I wanted to stop having to do things for money as soon as possible.

I realized at the start of 2024, shortly before the [first blog post](/blog/v0.1.0/), that yet another reason I looked forward to retirement was because it meant to me no longer needing to worry about leaving a legacy (or in my words at the time, no longer needing "to prove anything"). I could finally sit back and look back on my life's achievements -- however modest or magnificent they may be -- without feeling the need to add any more to the list. "That was me, that's what I did with my life." Even if the legacy was a humble one, I could at least stop worrying about making it grander. But why wait for retirement to start doing that? The night I decided to stop worrying about the cumulative output of my life, I rested more deeply than I had in years. Rest became *real rest* for the sake of rest, as opposed to rest as mere temporary relief for the sake of getting back up and going at it again tomorrow.

(Once again, I can see how my uncritical reading of the biographies of famous people as a kid helped engender such a complex in me. "Look at how this amazing person did X, Y, and Z before he died, forever gracing future generations with the brilliant results of his life's work!" As a kid, I ate that shit up. If me as a kid was my higher self, he'd be returning back to the store to ask, "Umm, yeah, so I rented this human experience that was advertised as a 'genius prodigy changes the world' kind of story, and so far the plot has been super interesting but it's not actually going where it's supposed to go," and the store employee would respond with, "Oh yeah, that's one of the many ironic titles in that genre. You might want to try out the *Elon Musk* experience instead -- that one's ironic too, but it might be more your style. Be warned, that one comes with its own unique form of psychological suffering, as all earthly experiences do.")

Over the course of 2024, I would occasionally catch myself fantasizing about retirement again and realize that I was overworking myself. Some three months ago, I once again found myself fantasizing about retirement, and so I tried to deconstruct the feelings as I had done before. "What now? What is it about the 'retirement' label that appeals to me this time around? And whatever it might be, how can I once again integrate that into my current life?" It was a confusing introspective process, and I was getting real tired of always having the same word crop up again and again, when it occurred to me: Why not just take the whole goddamn label for myself if I like it so much?

The obvious reason why not is that with Trump's tariff chaos and general global geopolitical instability, right now seems like a particularly unwise time to retire. Right now seems like exactly when you'd want to buckle up for the ride ahead instead of relaxing completely. On the other hand, if I don't feel financially secure enough to retire at the apogee of American politico-economic might and influence, with a personal financial runway that's measured in decades at current expenditure rates, I think I might just never feel financially secure enough to retire. It would be good to experience retirement at least once in my life, and retiring now with a young body sounds like a much better idea than retiring in my 60's.

There's a very good chance that I'll have to come out of retirement at some point in my life. If I have kids, if American political instability creates a meltdown in US-based financial assets, if I get an expensive form of cancer, if my immediate family needs extensive financial aid after some disaster, if Cambodia leapfrogs forward into becoming a way more developed and way more expensive country over the next few decades, if AI upends the current economic system entirely -- if any one of many semi-plausible scenarios happens, I'm going to have to figure out one way or another of making some income again. I mean, look man, it happens. Fucking 95-year-olds [get evicted into homelessness](https://globalnews.ca/news/10798239/95-year-old-living-bc-er-care-home-eviction/amp/) for failure to pay rent. But just because you get forced out of retirement at some point doesn't make you any less retired during your retirement.

Let me just adopt that label and see what happens. I've not been working professionally as a software engineer for the last three years anyways. It's literally just a personal change of label from "unemployed" software engineer to "retired" software engineer. Not a legal change of label, mind you -- I'm still legally self-employed in Cambodia, and I have consistent income, just not from actively programming for anyone else. I don't need anyone else to recognize this label; I just want to try it on for myself, because every label comes with an attitude, and I wish to see how the retirement attitude feels on me.
