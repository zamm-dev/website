It's not clear to me when this happens either. I remember when I was working from home during the pandemic, I would often spend hours laying in bed, procrastinating on work but also feeling highly stressed over the procrastination. I just needed to get up and do the work that I knew entirely how to do (unlike with fixing the leaky faucet). You didn't need to convince me that it was in my best interests to do the work -- I was already convinced myself. Logically, it simply didn't make any sense to stress over it for hours instead of simply doing the work, but somehow I felt bound by an illogical subconscious.

I distinctly remember one occasion on which I was so frustrated by this situation that I forced myself to get out of bed, forced myself to get to my chair that was two steps away from the bed, forced myself to sit down on the chair, forced myself to open the laptop lid, forced myself to wait for the login screen to pop up a couple of seconds later, forced myself to type in the password and wait for the desktop screen to load a few seconds after that -- and by this point I had consciously *forced* myself to do so much that I was completely exhausted and collapsed back in bed. It was completely ridiculous. There's no reason why it should feel so *excruciatingly* hard to login to the laptop when, at other times, it's literally just one continuous motion that barely registers as an action in my brain. It's not normal for a computer login to feel this difficult. Something was not right.
