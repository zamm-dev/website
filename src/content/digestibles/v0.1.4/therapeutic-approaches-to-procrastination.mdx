Two different therapists had no definite explanations and no permanent solutions to get me to do something that I didn't want to do. The first one treated it as I did: this is a problem, how do we fix it? We tried a bunch of different methods, the best one of which was me holding myself accountable by emailing him the day before about my plans for the next day. The next day after work, I would email him about how it all went. At first, fear of disappointing my therapist (which was no more illogical than the procrastination) caused me to finally have some carefree days where I finished work early and enjoyed guilt-free relaxation time. Alas, my subconscious started testing boundaries as usual, and soon enough discovered that there was no need to fear disappointing the therapist after all. Out with the fear, back in with the stress.

I had heard from one of my friends that he once popped some Adderall before starting some math homework, and before he knew it two hours had passed and he had filled out pages and pages of math homework. God, that sounded *just* like what I needed. The worst part of work was that I had to be conscious for it all. The tasks would be just difficult enough that I couldn't zone off entirely (like I can when I'm doing some monotonous physical task like washing the dishes), but also not difficult enough for my mind to feel fully stimulated or engaged. I wanted to just pop a pill, and then "before I knew it" hours have passed and all my work was done, just like what had seemed to happen for my friend, and what was described in [*Office Space*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/):

> Peter: "Is there any way that you could sort of just zonk me out so that, like, I don't know I'm at work... in here [pointing to his head]? Could I come home and think that I've been fishing all day, or something?"

(Incidentally, the show [Severance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)) explores this concept in a literal manner. I highly recommend it.)

As such, my therapist and I ended up getting me to try out a bunch of different pills too: Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Strattera, possibly some others I've forgotten. Vyvanse was my favorite. The comedown made me sad, but it was an enjoyably rich and tasteful kind of sad, the kind that made me ambivalent about living or dying -- but not in a depressing way, more in a "Que sera, sera" kind of way. Strattera simply made me anxious and stressed, not about anything in particular, but just as if there was going to be some stressful situation that I must confront in the next few hours. At best, these pills got me *really* invested in whatever I was procrastinating with. I wasn't any better at doing things I didn't want to do, but [bughouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bughouse_chess) games were *so* much fun on Vyvanse that I literally said out loud "This is *so* much fun!" multiple times, as if I had to tell that to myself in disbelief just to affirm how unbelievably fun it was indeed.

(For what it's worth, I did discover that it was a lot of fun to play both boards against low-ranked players, and keep one board entirely pristine without moving any of its starting pieces. See this game where I'm the bottom player on both boards:

This is of course only a viable strategy against inexperienced players who don't coordinate to pause and force me to move.)

The second therapist approached it from the angle of a childhood trauma response. I did unearth lots of common threads running throughout my life, such as how things were always happening to me on a schedule that I neither understood nor had any input on, and so perhaps I got good at accepting whichever environment I found myself placed in, but not so much at taking responsibility for molding my own environments as an adult. A lot of interesting ideas, to be sure, but we never got to actually tackling the problem on a practical level because we were continually searching for the root cause of it all, and there seemed to be no end in sight for this search.
