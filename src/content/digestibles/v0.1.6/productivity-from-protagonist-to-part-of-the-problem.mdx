As part of this journey to better understand and work with myself, I stumbled on the [Betwixt game](https://www.betwixt.life) by Hazel Gale. If there's one really useful insight I gleaned from that game, it's that I always feel rushed to accomplish things quickly, and yet despite all that rushing, I never feel as if I have enough time. If there's a second useful insight, it's that I've been taking the perspective of Productivity by default for so long because it's been much more willing to engage in verbal dialogue and to verbally justify its desires.

In reality, although Productivity may be more verbal than Procrastination, it certainly isn't any more forthcoming about its true motivations. Whereas Procrastination will continually find new ways to non-verbally sabotage the goal, Productivity will continually find new ways to verbally justify that same goal. For example:

1. Initial experiments with LLM-based productivity boosts proved quite promising, but clearly a lot of refinement would be needed to make this actually practically useful. The GUI version of ZAMM would be a way to build this properly from the ground up, rather than relying on a hacky mishmash of the unstable (at the time) [langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [ICE](https://github.com/oughtinc/ice), and [vcrpy](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy). Since the [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/zamm-dev/zamm/releases/tag/v0.0.5) had been built in less than a month, the proper GUI version would surely reach the same state in just a few months. At this time, there was no pushback.
2. As the months dragged on and progress turned out to be slower than expected, the new justification was that we were obviously not putting in enough effort. The proof-of-concept already existed, so clearly what we're attempting is entirely possible. Every single bit of delay is pushing back the sweet, sweet payoff we're going to get from getting back to where we were with the proof-of-concept, and it matters that we get there sooner rather than later because contributions at such a seemingly pivotal moment in history, where our skills are still relevant but not yet obsolete, could potentially have an outsized impact on our legacy. Through the strength of determination and willpower, Productivity was able to temporarily overcome Procrastination and ramped up to spending a couple months of full-time work on ZAMM. Progress was still not fast enough, but when Productivity tried ramping up even further, Procrastination took over with a vengeance instead.
3. Eventually, I came to [question](/blog/v0.1.3/) the need to leave behind a legacy. (I got there at the end of January but didn't properly blog about it until May.) The new justification was that getting ZAMM done would allow us to finally program free of an uncooperative subconscious that's always complaining about how annoying it is to program. (In retrospect, it's unclear if the annoyance is actually coming from Procrastination, or if it's a result of Productivity's need for speed.) At this point I was in a stalemate where I did a little bit of coding on most days to satisfy the productive side, and distracted myself with games in between coding sessions to soothe the procrastinatory side.
4. When I was [no longer convinced](/blog/v0.1.4/) that ZAMM would allow me to magically avoid my inner psychological conflicts, the new justification was that work on ZAMM could instead do the complete *opposite* and trigger the then-dormant mental conflict, so that we could finally figure out how to get Procrastination to stop its constant complaining. It was as if Productivity was the Japanese navy in WWII, looking for an [ultimate showdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantai_Kessen) with which it can decisively defeat the American enemy for once and for all. Like the Japanese navy, Productivity kept losing every showdown it was in fact able to find.

As it turns out, Productivity is great at framing the situation so that its goals are the obvious default that don't even need to be questioned, and Procrastination is the annoying saboteur that is always messing everything up with its obstinate refusal to work. "I" am the one trying to deal with unruly Procrastination, because I identified completely with Productivity. But it takes two to tango, and Productivity is *also* partially responsible for the conflict through its continual dissatisfaction with the amount of work put in. (When I was a kid, my sister said that it takes two hands to clap, and so I wished I knew how to snap my fingers to prove her wrong.)

This became obvious when I asked when Productivity would finally be happy with the amount of progress being made. That's when I realized the answer was "Never." After all, I had made it all the way to 8 hours of daily work for a brief stretch of time in Melbourne, but progress was still too slow then. As Productivity, I was still looking for ways to squeeze out further efficiency and output: perhaps I could take a shorter lunch break, or perhaps I could get started with the day quicker. The better thing to do at that point would have been to re-evaluate project direction, but I had been focused on dealing with my old foe Procrastination for so long that I kept on assuming they were the problem. Well, I suppose in a way Procrastination was indeed the "problem," in that they were doing their job by refusing to walk any further down a path that is clearly not producing the expected tangible results. But that only made it clearer to me that the obvious problem was with Procrastination refusing to work.

Liza has mentioned that the emotional energy you bring into an activity is often times the same energy you'll get out of it. For example, if you're working out at the gym because you feel insecure about your body, chances are good that you'll still feel insecure about your body after working out. Or as another example, the original ZAMM notes how we do science to escape from falsehood to absolute truth, but in doing so we discover that our new absolute truths are knocked down as falsehoods even faster than before:

> But there it was, the whole history of science, a clear story of continuously new and changing explanations of old facts. The time spans of permanence seemed completely random, he could see no order in them. Some scientific truths seemed to last for centuries, others for less than a year. Scientific truth was not dogma, good for eternity, but a temporal quantitative entity that could be studied like anything else.
>
> He studied scientific truths, then became upset even more by the apparent cause of their temporal condition. It looked as though the time spans of scientific truths are an inverse function of the intensity of scientific effort. Thus the scientific truths of the twentieth century seem to have a much shorter life-span than those of the last century because scientific activity is now much greater... What shortens the life-span of the existing truth is the volume of hypotheses offered to replace it; ... And what seems to be causing the number of hypotheses to grow in recent decades seems to be nothing other than scientific method itself. The more you look, the more you see... What this means logically is that as you try to move toward unchanging truth through the application of scientific method, you actually do not move toward it at all. You move away from it! It is your application of scientific method that is causing it to change!

This is of course not to say that science produces no progress whatsoever. As Isaac Asimov says in his essay [The Relativity of Wrong](https://hermiene.net/essays-trans/relativity_of_wrong.html):

> [W]hen people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.

Instead, this is just to say that if what you seek is absolute certainty, doing science does not actually bring you any closer to satisfying that emotional need.

I think this applies to me here too. A false sense of urgency from Productivity made me feel as if I had to rush to code, but rushed coding did nothing to assuage that false sense of urgency. Even if that sense of urgency sometimes allowed Productivity to force a win, Procrastination will make sure to take it even slower from then on out, until the temporary gains from the productivity win are completely erased. *Even then*, the slow pace will continue until frustration builds up enough for the productive side to force another win again. This cycle of failure can apparently apply to [larger teams](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-rules-crunch-mode-yonni-mendes/) as well:

> To be clear: Crunch Mode is not a long term strategy. It is a shock tactic and an expensive one at that. Following Crunch, productivity will dip, morale will temporarily suffer.

Just because "crunch mode" for me involves working a comically low 15 hours a week doesn't mean the mental effects don't apply to me all the same. And yet, despite the drastic recent dip in productivity, I'm glad I got this internal conflict to play out. Whereas the balance before felt like an unsatisfactory false peace, I now no longer feel quite as caught between a side that does not me rest, and a side that does not let me work. The conflict was ironically making me absolutely exhausted despite the lack of output.

I still don't know what the answer is. It's most certainly not to completely indulge Procrastination: if I let it run amok, it could mean I don't get fed for the whole day because I can't even muster up the will to so much as place a food delivery order. But repressing it hasn't worked for me either. The same is true for the productive side: repressing it leaves life feeling meaninglessly hedonistic. But just as there is no rush to work on ZAMM, there is also no rush to work on myself. This has been real progress, and I am grateful for that.

I used to feel frustrated at my seeming inability to do more experimentation with LLMs. It's understandable to have tried and failed at something, but what's absolutely insane is to not even try at all. I felt as if sometime in the decades to come, a young person will hold me responsible and ask, "So, how come you didn't do your part for the AI revolution? You were there. Why didn't you contribute?" This is of course just a projection of my internal emotions, because "what other people say" would only bother me so if I agreed with them on some level. But it was a question I didn't have an answer to. "I don't know man. I was right there, but I procrastinated through the whole thing. It was crazy."

Now, I feel that I can honestly say I tried. I truly tried, but I didn't know enough about software project management or self-sabotage to do a more effective job than what I have done. The lack of output is not proof that I never tried; the mental exhaustion is proof that I did. The most "impact" I've had was with helping some amount of people (however many people 717 stars on GitHub imply) visualize their langchain workflows with [Langchain Visualizer](https://github.com/amosjyng/langchain-visualizer), and I don't feel especially proud of that one given that it was just a cheap hack gluing together other people's disparate software packages. And it's okay that this is all the impact I've had. Knowing that I genuinely tried changes my personal narrative from one where I'm crazy and inexplicably lazy to one where I'm just another human being figuring out my first go at life.
