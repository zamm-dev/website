For me, this does raise the question around what exactly identity is. One year old me had much more in common with other one year old humans -- past, present, and future -- than he had with me. He acted like other one year olds, thought like other one year olds, lived like other one year olds. In a certain sense, just about the only thing connecting him and me is a continuous strand of identity running through the decades. What is that strand?

In the past, I have considered my socioeconomic circumstances not truly "me," because I don't get to fully control and define those circumstances. Taking this train of thought further, my body isn't truly "me" because I don't fully control it either, as evidenced by people who have bodies with diseases they never asked for. My body is just a mask through which I interact with the rest of the world. My subconscious isn't truly "me" because I don't fully control it. It's just a mask that takes care of a lot of behind-the-scenes interactions. I don't even get to pick my thoughts -- they just bubble up and I deal with them when they do. But when I take off all these masks to find the real "me" who is in complete control of his reality, I find that there's nothing at all. [There is no me.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anattā) I don't actually exist. It's all just masks, all the way down. (I originally got this masks analogy from a different context with [The Gervais Principle](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F9IV64W/), but I like it better in this context.)

Alternatively, there's the train of thought that goes that "society" doesn't exist, it's all just people. It's akin to saying that atoms don't exist, it's all just quarks. An "atom" is just an abstraction over quarks, a way for you to easily reason about an entire clump of quarks at the same time. But if you're able to reason about all the quarks separately, at no point does the idea of an "atom" *need* to enter the picture. And molecules are just abstractions over atoms, cells abstractions over molecules, and we ourselves are just abstractions over cells. Take away each of my cells, and there is no "me" left. I am nothing more than an idea, an idea that's a necessary convenience for all those ignorant observers that cannot reason about each of my cells separately. But physical reality is not ignorant about me like other humans are. I don't actually exist in physical reality; I exist only in the minds of ignorant observers such as myself.

But why shouldn't an idea be "real"? A quantum mechanical system is [fully described](http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/quantrev/node20.html) by its wavefunction. In a sense, it *is* its wavefunction. And what is a wave*function* but a mathematical construct, an idea? Perhaps all of physics is just the result of mathematical operations applied to mathematical constructs. If physics is real, then so is math, and if math is real, what isn't real anymore? I do actually exist. I am real. (Alternatively, "I think, therefore I am.")

Ideas are real. I used to think it was silly that the economy -- and all the physical actions it entails -- could grind to a halt based on arbitrary numbers like stock prices. But if you realize that the modern economy is a giant machine that uses these abstract numbers as its gears and levers, it's no wonder that the machine shudders when a cog slips out of place from where it's supposed to be. In a sense, the abstract idea of the central bank's interest rate is as real as a hurricane is in forcing physical economic activity to slow down. In a sense, money is more real than electrons. For millenia now, countless humans have had to understand money on some level to interact with their societies, but until recently nobody had to know anything at all about electrons to survive.

In the original ZAMM, Pirsig had written about his experience recovering from [ego death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death) (although he didn't call it that) after a session of eletroshock therapy:

> "This looks like a hospital," I said.
>
> They agreed.
>
> "How did I get here?" I asked... The man said nothing and the woman looked down. Very little was explained.
>
> ... [There was] a slip of paper from the probate court telling me that some person was committed as insane. Did they mean me?
>
> It was explained to me finally that "You have a new personality now." But this statement was no explanation at all. It puzzled me more than ever since I had no awareness at all of any "old" personality. If they had said, "You are a new personality," it would have been much clearer. That would have fitted. They had made the mistake of thinking of a personality as some sort of possession, like a suit of clothes, which a person wears. But apart from a personality what is there? Some bones and flesh. A collection of legal statistics, perhaps, but surely no person. The bones and flesh and legal statistics are the garments worn by the personality, not the other way around.
>
> But who was the old personality whom they had known and presumed I was a continuation of?
>
> ... He was dead. Destroyed by order of the court, enforced by the transmission of high-voltage alternating current through the lobes of his brain... I have never met him. Never will.

Who was that previous Pirsig? If he was just an idea, then that idea is now dead, replaced by a new idea inhabiting that body. But only one idea is dead -- that which he calls his "personality." Another idea -- the collection of legal statistics around that physical body -- has survived.

I've once accidentally encountered ego death too. I got so intoxicated that concepts started collapsing in on each other. Like a true programmer, I saw that one thing was merely an instance of another in a different context. Similar, but different, and therefore both could be combined into a still more fundamental idea. All this compressing, this reductionism, got me to start forgetting things. I forgot where I was. I forgot who I was. I forgot *what* I was.  Time and space and even the very concept of being a "human" ceased to have any meaning. All remaining boundaries between me and the rest of reality coalesced into a single monolithic duality. Breathing in and out. Yin and yang. True and false. Existence and non-existence. Eventually I forgot even about existence itself, and with that final boundary erased, there I was: One with the universe.

It is fitting for this loss of individuation to be called "ego death." After all, what is death subjectively, but a return to that Great Unity? That place where "I" no longer exist but also am not dead, because death is only meaningfully defined in contrast to life. Death is real in this universe, but "I" had already left this universe for a total nothingness where there was no life to be dead next to. "I" was simultaneously everything that ever was and ever wasn't, and nothing at all.

Zero kissed infinity. The kiss lingered on for an eternity that flew by in an infinitesimal instant. And so it was that I started detaching from the Great Unity -- a single shard of consciousness just starting to remember the concept of existence, but not yet the context in which it existed. It was [Rawls' veil of ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position) applied to the space of all possible realities. I ended up finding myself in a reality where all these concepts of money, social status, beauty, personality, religion, ideology, so on and so forth, existed -- but with no idea yet how I related to all those. I had recovered a mental map of reality, but not my coordinates on that map. I could not cast aspersions on the inhabitants of any region of that map because I might well end up being one of them.

When I did finally recover my map coordinates, I understood that there existed a brain at this particular junction of crisscrossing causes and effects in physical spacetime. That brain had temporarily rebooted and was starting to spin up its cognitive processes again. Eventually, some shard of consciousness or the other, without any say in the matter whatsoever, would have to be slotted to this brain here. For better or worse, *I* was that shard of consciousness. Here I found myself with a grand inheritance from the previous shard of consciousness that was slotted to this brain. I buried the dead shard next to its unfulfilled hopes and dreams, so that it may finally rest in peace.

Was that just a cheap mental trick to create a clean break with the past? Yes, of course it was. My ego death was nothing more than the death of an abstraction. But abstractions are real, and that's why the death of an abstraction can result in meaningful changes caused by nothing more than the death of that abstraction. This death is being ["born again"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_again) for Christians, allowing you to rise up from your baptism having shed off all the guilt of the person you once were, because now you know better and will do better. This death is the "new homunculus" in [*Replacing Guilt: Minding Our Way*](https://www.amazon.com/Replacing-Guilt-Minding-Our-Way/dp/B086FTSB3Q) wherein you close your eyes, pretend you're arriving in this body for the very first time, and shed any unproductive goals or expectations you inherited from the old inhabitant of the body. (Disclaimer: I've only read a friend's summary of the book.)

Abstractions are real, and so is my identity -- even if it is just a strand that can be snipped off in any arbitrary spot.
