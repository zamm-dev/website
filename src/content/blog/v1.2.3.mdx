Whereas months ago I felt very lucid, as if I were waking up with great self-awareness from a life I had been asleep in, I now find myself slipping back into a dream.

And why not? Why not allow the days to blur together and [the schedules to melt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory) into spontaneous vibes? Why not welcome and embrace the surrealist stream of pleasant waking reveries that saunter casually through the unmarked hours of the day?

Because by not living life intentionally, countless hours are wasted from scrolling through entertaining yet forgettable Instagram reels. But I live in the age of addictive social media. Do I imagine myself immune from the heavy pollution present in the communal information supply? If I arrived in Pittsburgh [a full century earlier](https://rarehistoricalphotos.com/coal-smoke-pittsburgh-photos/) than I actually had, would I imagine myself immune from the heavy smog that blocked out the midday sun? Time travelers would do well to note that you haven't truly experienced the Pittsburgh of 1913 until you find yourself hacking up some awfully dreadful phlegm. To be alive and present in this era is to partake in the suffering of this era; the inadequate personal mitigation of a systemic issue does not constitute a moral failure.

Because without proper planning, output suffers. To-do's pile up, and even the things that are done suffer from a lack of quantity and quality. But what needs to get done still gets done. If it gets done late, it's late by an acceptable delay. If it gets done poorly, its poor quality is still within acceptable tolerances. The lack of meaningful consequences -- the budget for mistakes that still sits there entirely unspent -- shows that I am still operating far short of any practical boundaries. Perhaps I too can learn to be [差不多](/blog/v0.1.3/) after all.

I went to a friend's home and saw perhaps the messiest home I have witnessed in living memory. Accumulated debris covered up every available surface; the various rooms remained accessible only  thanks to the desire paths tracing through the ground-level junk. The kitchen sink was piled up with dishes of all sorts, half-submerged in a layer of murky water that had nowhere to go because the entire bottom of the sink turned out to be blanketed by egg shells mixed in with leftover rice. As disgusting as such a description may sound on the surface, an experience isn't defined by [raw facts alone](https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/); the particular photographic filter applied can entirely subvert an otherwise straightforward read on the subject matter. Such a scene would have aroused an intense sense of shame and self-loathing had I found it inside my own home, but processed through the lens of this being a good friend I had great respect for, the lesson I learned was thus: it is entirely possible to be *this* messy and still be a motherfucking baller.

And why not apply that to my own life? I have zero desire to live in such a physically messy state, but perhaps I could accept being a bit more temporally messy. Why not stop fighting entropy for a second and just see where it takes me? If the [ability to direct my own actions](/blog/v1.2.0/) despite great internal resistance gives me freedom to maneuver, so too does the ability to recalibrate my [inner loss](https://gwern.net/backstop) sense of discomfort for when things are going "wrong."

I have "regressed," one could say. Yet as I find myself once again revisiting a former period of my life, I find that this way of life isn't nearly half as bad as I'd once felt it was. It has its downsides, to be sure, but it has its own vibe as well. I remember when a friend once showed me how a strongly dissonant dyad can be made consonant simply through the [addition of supporting notes](https://youtu.be/Be5ZxzZhVaI?si=QYbTFhdxb8Va3WlY&t=564). For reasons beyond my musical comprehension, this time around those same [formerly discordant notes](/blog/v0.1.6/) now add up to a far more harmonious life consistent with the ["one thing" rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtrQUoRJ_W4) from *City Slickers* that another friend told me about, except that in my case the "one thing" wasn't reached by intentional prioritization of one goal above all, but by an accidental alignment of work, play, volunteering, socializing, art, spirituality, and life into one unified unnamed cause. Whether directly or indirectly, everything I do plausibly contributes to everything else:

- Using AI at work (at a new venture my business partner and I have started), on "real" codebases solving real problems, directly benefits my understanding of the landscape around AI coding and around what would make for an actually effective coding automation tool for myself.
- Hacking on such a coding automation tool for fun also directly benefits the company once we release it under the company name, and also gives me something to talk about and represent the company with at the open source conference I'm volunteering for.
- Leading a volunteering team for the open source conference has been a great trial run for baby's first leadership experience. The conference itself will of course a great place to network and meet other FOSS professionals, which all greatly benefits my effectiveness as a cofounder.
- Catching up with friends old and new is a great way to inform others about the business in case they are ever in need of its services, and is also a great way to get fresh information on the current state of the tech industry from the perspective of active employees and lower-level managers.
- The crafting of software (including coding itself, software architecture, and the design of organizational processes that promote software delivery and excellence) is the exercise of an art form. More generally, the enjoyment of art produced by others provides for inspiration in all other areas of life.
- The creation or performance of art is itself a spiritual act of [transmitting the Transcendence](https://youtu.be/dMpJFbwR8OM?si=JgpGAK7qXWw4_wAW&t=320).
- The very act of living is spiritual, and the more I fully live out each aspect of my life, the more I fully embed Quality into that aspect of my life.

What is good for one cause is good for all; ergo there is no need to do stringent accounting of how many resources are spent on which goals.

There are of course plenty of counterarguments to be had as to why these should actually be separate [non-overlapping magisteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria). And even if I am to keep it all unified, I recognize that this sort of thinking is highly susceptible to rationalization that turns legitimate cross-pollination into farce. Despite all this, I think what matters here is not so much what is true but what is useful, because so far the improvements to sustainable living on a personal level speak for themselves: Unlike [last year](/blog/v0.2.1/), I end this year fully ready to start the new.

## Renewed War

Since the [last time](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.2/war/) I wrote about the war, the conflict has sparked up and ended again. This time around, I no longer lament the emphasis on centuries-old relics of the ancestors. For better or for worse, these relics are the cultural backbone of Cambodian national identity. To damage them is to break Cambodian bones; to steal them is to lop off Cambodian body parts. Was it optimal to form a national identity that rests so squarely on ancient artifacts? No matter -- optimal or not, these are now the load-bearing columns that the entirety of modern Cambodian identity seems to be built upon, in one way or another. Nor would the non-existence of the temples help matters; if it weren't for the temples, then there would've been a conflict over some other topic near and dear to Cambodia's heart (as happened with Carthage when Rome made a series of increasingly ridiculous demands, [culminating in one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Carthage_(Third_Punic_War)#Background) that required the Carthaginians to pick up their entire city and move it 16 km inland). As far as I can tell, the apparent conflict is not the real driver of conflict; it is only the conduit through which the conflict is conducted between two neighboring ethnic groups who have a history of not particularly liking each other very much.

In both rounds of hostilities, I've heard of stories of social repercussions for those who challenged the Cambodian narrative in any way. It is fair that a group under physical assault is in dire need of group cohesion. Given that group identity is itself nothing more than a meme, I can see there being a need for memetic purity. No more waffling, no more nuances, everybody who could possibly be thought of as in-group needs to pick their fucking side *now*.

I naturally have a bias towards neutrality just because of my demographics as a foreigner. That of course doesn't necessarily make it the right bias. Given my particular set of Bayesian priors, I cannot help but feel that there are some things about the Cambodian narrative that I don't quite understand. Certain questions still linger in the air -- questions that I'm sure have entirely innocuous answers, but questions that I nonetheless get the sense I'm not supposed to ask.

But The Narrative is not asking to be understood. It is asking to be felt and heard, as a form of communal social bonding. You cannot properly commiserate with the pain, the grief, the *anger*, of Cambodian suffering at the hands of Thai villainy unless you meet your interlocutor where they're at in the context of The Narrative. And once you enter that context, you find that the lingering questions disappear. The specific details on how exactly this or that happened are irrelevant compared to the great harm being visited continually on this peaceful but weak nation. [History nerds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community) can do all the nitpicking they want later, but the nation is hurting right now at the hands of a powerful abuser. [Perception is reality](/blog/v0.1.2/), and therefore if you wish to know how it feels to be on the receiving end of unjust and unprovoked violence, you only need be here in Cambodia.

The Narrative disperses like the morning fog as soon as I talk to someone outside of Cambodia who is even more predisposed to neutrality than I am. They ask those same lingering questions I had, except that I have no ready answers for them either. Some questions I never had an opportunity to ask close friends about -- close friends who I could trust to value our relationship over that of The Narrative. There was one question where the person I asked was grossly misinformed about the situation. The most common response I got was អត់ដឹងដែរ, from folks who did not know the answer themselves because these questions are not often asked or answered under The Narrative. If narratives could have insecurities, these would be it: sore spots that you would do better than to poke and prod at if you don't want to trigger a negative reaction from the human vessel of The Narrative.

To be clear, I don't think this is at all unique to the Cambodian narrative. I also have plenty of questions about the Thai narrative, but I am not in the right country to ask such questions to folks who would be naturally inclined to steelman their responses. Given what I've heard about this being background news in Thailand (reminiscent of the background news in America around the [GWOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror)), I wonder if the social pressures for the Thai narrative in Thailand are comparatively lesser.

This is not to say that the narratives stand on equal footing. I am still unsure about what happened a few months ago, but the aggressor in the most recent round of fighting seems to me to be somewhat clearer. The motive, the opportunity, and the actions taken all line up. Yet knowing what I now know of Southeast Asian culture, I hesitate to write publicly about my personal hunches. Southeast Asia is, in general, a place where you do not criticize others out in the open. You praise and flatter them to their face in public, before spreading damaging news and rumors behind their back in private. This is often seen as two-faced by those unused to such norms, but it also makes sense within this cultural context. For better or for worse, [face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(sociological_concept)) is hugely important in Southeast Asian society. To damage someone's face is to key someone's car. You wouldn't do it to their face (no pun intended) any more than you would key someone's car as they're standing right in front of it, unless you are looking for a defamation lawsuit or a physical fight, respectively. And when the general public is unused to such direct confrontations, doing so yourself means you're signaling a much stronger affront than you mean to send, to someone who has also had a lot less practice dealing maturely with situations of this sort than you do.

(Exceptions come to mind. For example, it is perfectly acceptable to publicly shame a stranger who never paid for the product you sent them. It is also very common to shame someone publicly through your Instagram stories, so long as you avoid referring to them by name. You know they can see your story, *they* know you're talking about them, but because you have the thinnest veneer of plausible deniability, this lack of [shared public knowledge](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/05/19/epistemic-logic-temporal-epistemic-logic-and-the-blue-eyed-islander-puzzle-lower-bound/) somehow means that a confrontation can be avoided even though you both know perfectly well what's going on here.)

This is unfortunately the kind of dynamic that allows abusers to continue hiding in plain sight. It is the kind of dynamic that leads to transgressors getting pissed over the reputational damage dealt to them by their victims instead of, you know, being sorry about the transgression that caused their own reputational damage in the first place. It is the kind of dynamic that has led to two stories I've heard of now, across two separate Southeast Asian countries, where pedophiles were initially swept under the rug to protect the reputations of everyone affiliated. To the extent that these pedophiles were exposed, it was only because sufficiently Westernized individuals eventually got involved. It is a suboptimal dynamic in many ways, but just because your society finds itself in a [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) located far from the [Pareto frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_front) does not mean you yourself are well-placed to help dislodge society from this equilibrium. It is why it makes sense for restaurant-goers to [keep tipping](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/02/be-nice-at-least-until-you-can-coordinate-meanness/) in the US even if they firmly believe American tipping culture is an evil that should be done away with.

Should what applies to individuals also apply to countries? [The personal is political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political), after all. I get the sense that both Cambodia and Thailand would rather third parties (such as I) praise their beauty in public while reserving our criticism for private conversations. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When parents fight, little kids had better run and hide than pick a side, even if one parent is being abusive. I accept that this can certainly be interpreted as a rationalization of my personal cowardice, but I think it bears acknowledging that there is a global cooling on self-expression. You never know who is watching and recording even obscure blogs, as [Alistair Kitchen found out](https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/how-my-reporting-on-the-columbia-protests-led-to-my-deportation) a little too late. How many decades am I going to continue to live in Southeast Asia for? It behooves me to keep in mind that anything I write here is forever etched like a tattoo onto my public identity. I can always say more later, but the only time to say less is now. Given how much I enjoy speculating about the mechanics of the meta, it simply makes more sense for me to focus on this topic rather than contributing yet another online polemic against either side in this war.
