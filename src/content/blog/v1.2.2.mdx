I sometimes get the sense that I come across as coherently insane to certain others. I last felt this a few months ago when I defended [a line of reasoning](/blog/digestibles/v0.1.6/ego-death/) that enables me to conceptualize economic numbers (and abstract ideas in general) as real and existing.

This particular interaction started over the meaning of the price of Bitcoin. You see, most online discussion on Bitcoin (and crypto in general) centers around its pricing rather than the value it brings to society. I used to sympathize with this view and would lament how the crypto scene had transformed from an insular group of nerds with a genuine passion for human freedom as expressed through technology, into a scene chock full of chumps who FOMO in looking only for a quick profit, with nary an understanding of how crypto works or why it even exists apart from being a vehicle for "price goes up." I have on multiple occasions asked such "normies" if they kept their crypto in their own wallet or on the exchange; they did not know the difference and had never even heard of a private key. When these types of retail investors lose their shirt from panic selling over market volatility because they never understood that this is a risk-on asset, or get scammed or phished because they never understood that these are unlike your standard reversible fraudulent credit card charges, I feel that a lot of blame for their regrettable experiences is unfairly heaped on crypto itself rather than on their own reckless behavior that I find incomprehensible given my specific monetary personality.

But I now take the view that this is an inevitable phenomenon given the incentives involved in the [formation of subcultural scenes](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths) such as this one. Instead of a flood of normies who want to get in on a cool music scene, you got a flood of normies who want to get in on this profitable financial scene. These normies have absolutely zero ability to discern between genuinely groundbreaking projects and shitcoins with flashy buzzwords that generate all the right hype on social media, providing fertile ground for the latter to flourish and thereby generating a ton of noise drowning out the signal for everyone involved. It is fair that in such an environment, common wisdom for the common folk is "Don't get involved in crypto, it's all a big scam" -- because if you lack the ability or the interest to do *any* of:

- familiarizing yourself with trading markets and how to avoid exposing yourself to more financial risk than you intend to
- familiarizing yourself with cryptographic primitives enough to have a danger sense for when something carries with it the stench of a rotting scam that's been left out baking in the sun for days
- familiarizing yourself with what you're looking to invest funds in, to the extent where you can at least explain their value proposition to the crypto ecosystem, the assumptions that such a value proposition is based on, and the various risks your funds are exposed to for so long as they are parked there
- familiarizing yourself with the basic security protocols of being your own bank, and taking personal responsibility for the financial losses that accrue from mistakes you *will* be making
- familiarizing yourself with how to critically evaluate the trusthworthiness of a source of information, especially when they concern any of the above

then you are truly better off avoiding the whole space altogether because you are exactly the type of person who is overwhelmingly likely to find themselves losing lamentable sums of money from manipulation, whether that manipulation is done consciously by persuasive humans or unconsciously by the siren song of candlestick patterns.

(I sometimes wonder whether the market as a whole has implicitly picked up on quirks of human psychology, with candlestick charts perfectly tuned to maximize psychological stress on the average human. Perhaps we can even generalize short-term trading as mostly a game of manipulative wealth extraction from all other insufficiently sophisticated actors: profitable forms of [human-scale technical analysis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp) contribute to the emotional manipulation of humans on human timescales, whereas profitable ML models contribute to the manipulation of other trading algorithms on HFT timescales. Perhaps we worry so much over how to align AI towards our human-defined goals because there's already precedent for computer algorithms blindly learning how to align humans towards their system-defined metrics. The tech industry did not start out intentionally causing internet addiction, but internet addiction is the natural end result of billions of dollars worth of "programmer-codebase-A/B testing" systems optimizing for engagement via the continual scanning of billions of half-consenting individuals for traces of statistically significant quirks in the human dopaminergic reward circuitry.)

In any case, I now take the view that far from being an irrelevant distraction, Bitcoin's price action is actually core to its present value proposition in the crypto ecosystem: that of being a stable long-term store of value. It's interesting that money appears to have been deconstructed into [its various functions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money.asp) in the crypto world: the stability of stablecoins clearly make for superior units of account (though of course it could be argued that this is fundamentally fulfilled by the fiat rather than crypto nature of stablecoins), the speed and low transaction costs of Ethereum L2/Solana and the privacy of Monero clearly make for superior mediums of exchange, and the DeFi smart contracts on top of some of these networks enable deferred payments to even happen in the first place. Within this deconstructed world, there exists a [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) wherein the longer that Bitcoin sustains a consistently high valuation, the more credible it becomes as a viable long-term store of value.

This was when someone lamented the treatment of economic numbers as anything more than a mere figment of the human imagination. They proclaimed that we should be liberating humanity from accounting spreadsheets rather than further weighing ourselves down by the arbitrary shuffling of bits on distributed ledgers. I of course brought in the "abstractions exist" viewpoint. I may be very wrong about Bitcoin, but casting numbers in such a villainous light comes across to me as a great example of self-defeating anarchist idealism. Humanity has repeatedly improved its conditions by reinforcing its usage of tools and machinery, and I expect the same to be true of economic tooling and machinery, though these be made of automated numerical spreadsheets rather than physical concrete and steel. Instead of trying to move away from numbers, we should instead be further refining their effectiveness and discovering even more ways to usefully apply them.

Somebody else noted that this was a meaningless quibble over semantics. On the contrary, I felt that it is useful to hold multiple perspectives on existence. In machine learning, it is sometimes easier to find the solution by solving for [the dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(optimization)) instead of the primal. For example, if you're trying to pick a meal at a restaurant, the choice that maximizes your satisfaction is mathematically equivalent to the choice that minimizes your dissatisfaction, even though -- and precisely *because* -- the problems are the complete opposite of one another. In physics, you can choose the frame of reference that allows you to most easily discover the solution; this could even mean choosing a rotational frame of reference that adds [fictitious forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_force) to your equations. You can apply philosophical labels any which way you want, but at the end of the day, whether you're [a platonist or a formalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/ihoto2/comment/g31hpb0/), or [a Bayesian or a frequentist](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22/bayesian-and-frequentist-reasoning-in-plain-english), you will still arrive eventually at correct math just the same as everyone else. This exact reason why some find these quibbles meaningless is *also* the exact reason why I find them meaningful: if it it really doesn't matter which label we apply, then we may as well keep all routes open so that we can always pick the fastest one for any given situation.

And if we allow ourselves to take the abstract as real, then the notion of "freeing" humanity from numbers becomes as obviously farcical as freeing humanity from buildings. Buildings, and all the attention and care that we lavish upon them to keep them from collapsing, are obviously not The Problem with Humanity. I defend "abstractions are real" as a concept because it gives me a handy shortcut to dismiss ideological crusades of this sort against the abstract. I'm sure I could defend the idea of "Numbers are important" by a much more circuitous route involving arguments around the expected utility that such numbers imply, paired with an appeal to consequentialist ethics to drive home the importance of expected utility to the listener's values -- but why bother with all that when it's easier and more fun to defend the idea that ideas genuinely exist?

Unless... unless I can generalize this shortcut to one that's just as reachable from the primal. So numbers aren't real. They're just figments of the human imagination, conjured as a convenient stand-in for the physical. Very well. But you know what else is imaginary? Society. Society is a convenient stand-in for groups of actual physical humans, each one of which is also just a convenient stand-in for groups of actual physical cells, which are just groups of actual physical chemicals, which are just groups of atoms, which are just quarks, and those in turn are possibly just strings. At some point the abstractions become [leaky](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) and you need to delve into the substrate to explain certain details in the superstrate, because the superstrate never actually existed. Tear down economic numbers because they don't exist? Well, neither do buildings, which are mere illusions over the raw bricks and concrete that actually exist. These illusions may be powerful enough to confine and bind us inside them for the majority of our lives, but they are obviously not The Problem with Humanity.

One exasperated response I received was that I merely need stand in front of a lion to disabuse myself of the notion that lions don't exist. (I found it ironic that "You just try to act as if lions aren't real and see how far you get" works just as well for justifying numbers on spreadsheets as something that's actually real, which was exactly my original point.) Unfortunately, all that such an experiment could possibly prove is that some physical atoms are interacting with other physical atoms. It proves as little as [Samuel Johnson kicking a rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone) did. If we want to actually prove something about the physical world, we have to be scientific about it. If you wish to prove me wrong, then what you need to do is to devise a physical experiment where my model of the world where lions don't exist predicts something different from your model of the world where lions do exist.

You see, if you account for all the atoms of a lion, you can explain everything about the lion-system without any need for a "lion" to exist. The existence of the "lion" is an irrelevant variable that might as well be eliminated by Occam's razor. Your human eyes may perceive a "lion," but that's just human pareidolia, like seeing Jesus on toast. It's like adding God to physics. Unless you can find an equation for "God" to play a part in, "God" is just an extra irrelevant variable. "God exists" and "God doesn't exist" both explain the physical world just as well, at least as far as anyone can tell, and I choose "God/the lion doesn't exist" on days when I'm feeling feisty.

And so, assuming access to a fully accurate model of physics, and assuming access to all the information about all the wavefunctions of every quark in existence, and assuming access to enough computational power to crunch the probabilities on all future possibilities -- none of which I have but all of which the universe is -- my model will predict exactly the same thing as any other accurate model that has a "lion" variable in it. Sure, models with "lion" in them will be far superior in situations where there is a lack of access to physics, information, or computation. But something that exists purely as a figment of human ignorance hardly sounds any more authoritative than something that exists purely of human imagination, no?

The retort came that lions existed long before any humans conceived of them as such. The objector was not so egoistic as to deny the existence of other living things outside of the human perception of them. Ah, but you see, lions never existed. Never have, never will. They exist as little as I do, which is why I would say this is an egoless rather than egoistic perspective on the world. There is simply no room for the ego -- not mine, not anyone else's -- in a world that's been wholly filled up by pure physics. It is certainly not the only perspective you can take on the world, but it does appear to be a valid one.

There were many more objections that ended up provoking interesting thoughts in me:

- "Delusion" is indeed one framing for why Bitcoin (or fiat currencies) is valuable. Another framing is that social reality *is* reality. The King of England is whoever everyone agrees the King of England is. It may just be a silly social fabrication, but it's a silly social fabrication that used to carry so much weight that entire wars were fought over it. It's easiest to explain parts of the Hundred Year's War as "The King of England, who existed, decided that England would war with France, both of which also existed" as opposed to "The 'King of England' was a mere delusion, as was the very idea of an 'Englishman' or a 'Frenchman,' and yet certain individuals used this one other individual as a Schelling point to inflict physical violence on some other individuals across the Channel."
- It's silly that the economy depends so much on "line go up." Yet "line go up" does arguably represent to some imperfect degree the collective hopes and expectations for the future. Why invest in something unless you hope or expect it to produce positive ROI in the future — in other words, unless you expect a brighter future in that particular corner of reality? Asset prices reflect to some extent the collective estimation of this hope. Since we've structured our debt-based economy to run on this hopium for a better future, "line go down" naturally reflects a state of fuel starvation for the economic engine that runs the world. When this engine sputters, of course everyone's lives get worse for a little while as the necessary [painful readjustments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction) occur. Perhaps even for a long, long while, should the sputtering engine output insufficient power to the hopium extraction facilities.

  Should we have avoided building an economy so helplessly dependent on hopium? I don't see how we could have. [People do what works](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/), and what worked for the past couple centuries was building a society on cheap and plentiful hopium and non-renewable resources, future refactoring challenges be damned.
- Do shipping lanes exist? One could say they don't, that the only things that exist are contiguously linked bodies of water that ships are able to float through. It's lamentable that the US military expends so much effort and resources to protect shipping lanes that don't even exist, although it is a good thing that ships in select aquatic regions of the world are physically well-protected due to this effect. Or... one could say that they do exist, that they form the arteries of intercontinental commerce, and any [blockages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Suez_Canal_obstruction) or [cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_crisis) made to the arteries inhibit the healthy well-being of the global economic organism, and by extension the healthy well-being of the organism's most vital organ, the US.
- As much as I may dislike IP laws, I do appreciate that they made the revolutionary step of reifying abstract ideas as first-class legal entities. The legal system treats your intellectual property as seriously as it does any other physical property: you can buy it, sell it, license/rent it out with certain restrictions, etc. I still dislike them because in my opinion, they are at this point a ham-fisted way to copy-paste ideas around physical ownership onto the digital realm, in a way that restricts rather than takes full advantage of the possibilities of cheap bits.

  This naturally led to yet another very interesting conversation around funding for the arts and other IP-heavy industries like journalism. I definitely don't want the arts to be confined to the most privileged members of society, nor do I want the free press to wither away, whether from lack of funds or government censorship. But I also don't understand why there must be such an insistence on securing such livelihoods specifically through the [continual encroachment](https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/777788/rolling-stone-penske-media-sue-google-ai-overviews) of copyright schemes on the personal freedom to process and transmit information (aka freedom of speech).
  
  Am I allowed to read the biggest news of the day and summarize it for a friend? If I am, am I allowed to ask my own AI running on my own computer (for example, an Ollama instance with access to the web browser) to summarize the day's news for me? There would be no difference as far as the external web server is concerned, and it feels extremely dystopian to restrict the computations you're allowed to do behind the privacy of your own screen, like a form of digital thought-crime. If I am allowed to do that, am I allowed to share the results with a friend? If so, am I allowed to share the results with a stranger? If so, how many strangers am I allowed to share the results with? If that number is unlimited, what's the difference between me sharing it entirely by myself, and others pitching in to help me share it -- i.e. when we share it together behind the united front of a corporation? Here is where I do see some sense in [Citizens United's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC) stance on corporate personhood, in a philosophical manner if perhaps not in a practical manner. Maybe it is indeed impractical to have no limits whatsoever on private communications between two private parties (what Google and I voluntarily talk about is nobody else's business), but where is the line to be drawn? Given that IP laws currently affect both individuals *and* corporations, is it not fair to question the proposed levying of restrictions on legal persons other than myself?

  Alas, this was one of many topics where my interlocutors lost interest just as I felt like the subject was beginning to get interesting.
- Someone noted how societies have long been able to function with a much less developed system of numbers than ours has. But if "Society have historically been able to function without advanced understanding of numbers" is a valid argument for the non-existence of numbers, the same is even more true of electrons and other physical particles.

  The follow-up was that we can observe subatomic particles, but we can't observe numbers. Yet anyone is free to observe the S&P 500 right now. It's certainly a lot more observable than subatomic particles. In the physical realm, we can augment our senses with equipment, such as Geiger counters, that produce numbers that allow us to peer into the density of certain subatomic particles in the area. The readings have error bars around them, but they do tell us something about reality. In the economic realm, we can augment our senses with equipment, such as markets that facilitate price discovery, that produce numbers that allow us to peer into the societal supply and demand for a commodity. The readings have error bars around them, but they do tell us something about reality.
- Someone told me that they loved their children very much. When their kids fall sick, they feel sick. Their kids are real to them; their kids' atoms matter to them. Their phrasing implied a negative valence to the word "abstraction," as if one can't love or care for an abstraction.

  Say you take the view "My children are very real, and I care about them because they are real." Very well, but you should also care about economic numbers because they too are real. Some numbers are the load-bearing structures that determine your children's current quality of life in this world; other numbers are the load-bearing structures that determine their hopes for a better future. Far from being abstract concepts, a happy childhood and hope for the future are also very real things you should want your children to have. Caring for the numerical structures we inhabit *is* part of how you care for your children. You should be as concerned about the structural integrity of these numbers as you are about the structural integrity of the physical bridge they cross every day on their way to school.

  Or say you take the view that "Numbers are just abstractions and abstractions don't exist." Very well, but your children are also abstractions, and I think we should care about your children, even if they don't technically exist. Just because something is an abstraction and doesn't actually exist doesn't mean you should therefore seek to tear it down or treat it like it's not important, because we certainly don't want to tear any humans down or treat them like they're not important. Same goes for the economic abstractions that don't exist. Same political position, different vector basis, so to speak.

"Real" and "imaginary" are just labels, philosophical narratives that we soothe ourselves with, arbitrary mappings from an infinite domain onto a range of just two elements. You can apply philosophical labels any which way you want, and I choose to apply them in such a way that humans are not fundamentally privileged relative to numbers. You are free to choose differently, but so long as you can't prove me wrong, the choice is entirely arbitrary. And when the choice is arbitrary, you can no longer just say "X is an abstraction, so it doesn't matter as much as Y." You'll have to individually justify why X matters less than Y.

(This is incidentally why I'm fine with [redefining racism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/) or exploitation on a purely intellectual level. I remember when the RMIT socialists gave me the [Marxist definition of "exploitation"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/vygodsky/unknown/surplus_value.htm) as any situation where you're getting paid less than the value you bring to the business. I mean, look, you're free to redefine "exploitation" to mean that. But voluntary work for extremely cushy pay -- still considered exploitation under their definition! -- is not what the average person thinks of when they hear that someone is getting "exploited," and you don't get to automatically keep the negative connotations of the word when you've swapped out its referent in a not-so-subtle sleight of hand. If that's what you think exploitation is, then I believe it is neither desirable nor even possible to rid ourselves of exploitation. Of course, that was a private discussion I had with the socialists, so they held no power over me. I suspect that the subconscious purpose of modern Newspeak is to enable [conflict theorists](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/) to leverage bystanders into [sanewashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanewashing) them in a public setting where few would dare proclaim, "I don't think it's a bad thing to exploit people.")

To be clear, at this point in my life, I am not beholden to the purely-physical worldview. I do believe that absolutely everything *can* be explained that way, but I don't believe that's the only way to explain everything either. The universe as we currently know it is an [underdetermined system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdetermined_system). Everything must add up, exactly and precisely, without any plot holes whatsoever. Everything must be fully explainable and entirely believable without any recourse to the supernatural. And yet, when you zoom out from the finer details and look at the correlation between playful synchronicities... perhaps you'll notice the striking resemblance of God winking at you anyways. It's there if you want to see it; it's not if you don't.
