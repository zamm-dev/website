I am going to end up living a disappointing life. Every time something couldn't be better in my life, something else was truly amiss. This has been true for my entire adult life, and will likely continue to be true for the rest of my adult life. There's always something wrong with life that just keeps it far from perfect. I learned to accept imperfection in the present, but there was still a part of me that implicitly believed that one of these days, I would finally figure out how to live the life I want to live in a way that satisfies all of my personal values. It was fine and dandy to live in the imperfect present moment because that was simply part of my journey towards one day getting to live in the perfect present moment.

I've come to accept that that day is never going to come. There appears to be an overwhelmingly good chance that whatever kind of life I choose is going to be majorly disappointing in some way:

- Perhaps I will never find myself a stable lifelong relationship.
- So perhaps I will prioritize that -- but find myself trapped in an unhealthy dysfunctional relationship because we valued stability over singlehood.
- Perhaps I'll never have kids of my own. I'm not one to think that the meaning of life lies in procreation, but there is meaning there all the same.
- So perhaps I'll prioritize having them at any and all costs, and be forced to watch my kids live a worse life in a worse world than I did.
- Perhaps I'll be extraordinarily financially constrained by dwindling poor investments (such as kids).
- So perhaps I'll prioritize the accrual of resources, and be extraordinarily temporally constrained by countless responsibilities.
- Perhaps I'll have to once again endure chronically soul-sucking busywork that I thoroughly detest.
- Perhaps none of my personal projects will ever come to full fruition in any meaningful way, forever condemned to being half-baked ideas with mediocre execution.
- So perhaps I'll prioritize doing absolutely everything that I want done in life, and be chronically stressed out or have chronic sleep deprivation.
- Perhaps I'll prioritize keeping my time free and my retirement viable, but only by living somewhere where I'm reminded of really poor public infrastructure every time I leave the house.
- Perhaps I'll instead live somewhere with good public infrastructure, but it's a somewhere that strongly dissuades me from complaining too publicly about the struggles I face as a citizen.
- Perhaps I'll instead live somewhere with better freedom of speech, but it's a somewhere with a crapton of bureaucracy and stifling social norms that force all edge cases like me onto the straight and narrow.
- Perhaps multiple or even most of these things. Millions have encountered such eventualities. Who am I to think that I am too karmically privileged to encounter them myself?

If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. But every obvious solution to one problem produces a different problem or two. For me to have to make absolutely *zero* hard trade-offs in life requires me to win multiple kinds of metaphorical lotteries, and even then I'm sure I'll be resourceful enough to discover a new major disappointment with life, either something I didn't even know to cherish until I unwittingly gave it up in exchange for everything else I wanted, or some still-missing ingredient I didn't think about that makes everything else click into place.

My life is going to be a pretty disappointing one in at least one way or the other; the only question is what flavor(s) of disappointment I prefer to taste. As I understand it, this is the Indian [*dukkha*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%E1%B8%A5kha) (what usually gets translated to English as "suffering") and the Chinese [吃苦](https://westchinatea.com/blog/swallowing-bitter/), though this is where I find mainstream Chinese culture gets a bit manipulative. I don't believe the 苦 I'm obliged to 吃 is the one where I trample over my values in service of imposed societal constraints. It could very well be the other way around: Self-actualization in the face of those very same adverse societal constraints, whether they be socioeconomic or cultural-political. The ability to maneuvre despite negative personal outcomes can only do me good, but even if I choose to exercise this ability, it won't be for whatever it is *you're* trying to get me to do. It rubs me the wrong way when authority figures abuse 吃苦 as a way of downplaying their own responsibilities or the negotiating power of others in the social contract.

I've tasted some of these flavors of disappointment before, and I may have to taste some of them again, all the way up to my deathbed. It's certainly far from being a uniquely disappointing life by 21st century standards, but it is disappointing nonetheless relative to the life I grew up believing I was going to live so long as I followed the prescribed cultural wisdom on how to conduct and apply myself. But this disappointing life is mine to live, and I am ready to live it in all its full disappointment. The [Magnum Opus that is my life](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.0/zammdev-as-art/) is not a magnum opus due to sparkling superiority over other stories, it is a magnum opus because it fully traces out in intricate detail the curious trajectory of a single individual in the whirlwind of 21st century terrestrial affairs. What was it like to live in the utopian flourishing and subsequent dystopian collapse of [Universe 25's rat society](https://www.sciencehistory.org/stories/magazine/mouse-heaven-or-mouse-hell/)? Thousands upon thousands of rats were entered into a magnificently unique telling of that story. There is a story to be told here as well, and I am whom it will be told to. I am ready to fully listen to the telling of this story, even if it doesn't have "happily ever after" waiting at the end as I had thought it would.

Or put another way, am I willing to fall in love with a Reality that is so disappointing? Am I willing to lean into its flaws and accept it for what it is, or will I continue to insist on a promise of eventual proper adherence to my specific tastes before I allow myself to be fully charmed? And when I am charmed, am I willing to be vulnerably infatuated with Life despite knowing that circumstance will force us to say goodbye one day, or will I insist on keeping my distance so that our eventual departure isn't so painful?

All narratives are false, but some are sometimes useful. To paraphrase [MCTB](https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-i-the-fundamentals/5-the-three-characteristics/), narratives come and go, narratives don't satisfy, and narratives ain't me. Now that I have written out a narrative, I can observe and reflect on it without taking it more seriously than the impermanent phenomenon that it is.

The first interesting thought that comes to my mind is that this is the complete opposite of the narrative where [I'm going to end up having a good life](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.1/the-good-life/). That one I find useful for assuaging anxiety, and this one I find useful for grounding myself and my expectations in an accepting manner rather than a depressing defeatist one.

The next is that this pattern of "high enabling the low" has cropped up for me twice now. First I had to [feel secure](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.1/the-good-life/) in my life before I could heathily process [feeling anxious](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.2/vulnerability/) like never before; previously, such anxiety would only paralyze. First I had to [feel like I had agency](/blog/digestibles/v1.2.0/agency/) before I could heathily process feeling as if there are serious negative consequences everywhere I turn; previously, such a feeling would leave me feeling trapped, as if I could not truly decide for myself how I wanted my life to go because there seemed no realistic way to thread my way between all undesirable outcomes. And of course, all of this requires a willingness to [sit with the present](/blog/digestibles/v1.1.0/presentness/) and truly accept it for all it is, without the escapist futurist salve of "Ah but things are going to be different." If I were truly okay with the present, I would not need things to be different. I could aim for a future trajectory where things are different, but that is itself different from *needing* to manifest that future trajectory. In a way, this is only possible now because life has finally become good enough for me to have a psychologically easier time recognizing just how bad it really is in relation to my preconceived notions of how it ought to be.

Finally, seeing narratives as just another temporary sensation allows me to finally understand how to "[drop the story](https://matthewroot.ca/2018/07/30/feel-the-feeling-and-drop-the-story/)." The story is of course a very easy frame to slip into, but it finally feels possible to slip out of it sometimes. No longer must I continually interpret the present moment as a point on a curve fitted to the past and extrapolated into the future; I can free myself to engage the present moment without any context for its continuity in the grand scheme of things.

Of course, this is all just another narrative by which I attempt to make sense of recent changes to my pscyhe. It can be dropped, but it has its uses as well. It has its uses, but also its limitations, beyond which it may as well be dropped.

## Incidental artifacts

I worked on ZAMM somewhat over the last month, so I suppose [this commit](https://github.com/zamm-dev/zamm-typescript-poc-12/releases/tag/v1.2.1) is the marker of progress at the second month mark. I've mostly just made it easier to use and reproduce the specific workflow I have there in my other personal projects as well.

A couple of days ago, I started [publishing on Medium](https://medium.com/@amosjyng/growth-f1f23c4f6d84) after [coming across](https://medium.com/never-stop-writing/the-rise-and-rapid-fall-of-medium-from-profitability-to-collapse-in-just-months-4d6460e40c36) a [number of articles](https://medium.com/@johnpearce650/whatever-happened-to-medium-6f8fcea77fe6) on how [shitty it's become](https://medium.com/open-microphone/what-went-wrong-with-medium-6d2892cc9398) and how much [trouble it's in](https://medium.com/readers-club/we-finally-know-what-really-happened-at-medium-01333aec56a3). Like a true disaster tourist, I suddenly wished to experience the platform while its human writing community still existed in a meaningful sense. Though, perhaps reports of its deaths are [greatly exaggerated](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tonystubblebine_senior-backend-engineer-activity-7283379823333244929-XXMD)...
